# Web-Scraping-Recipe-Links
A small program that extracts menu items from an excel file and creates text files containing the first 10 links for the webpages that has the recipe of the item. Made using googlesearch &amp; pandas.

The program without using parallel processing : /FINAL/code.py
The program using parallel processing : /FINAL/code1.py

The excel file being send when calling the function should have a column labelled as "Menu" which should contain all the items(like Brownie, Fried Rice etc.) for which we want to get the recipe links.
