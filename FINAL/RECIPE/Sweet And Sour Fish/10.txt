# Sweet and Sour Fish, Chinese Sweet and Sour Fish Recipe

**Sweet and Sour Fish, Chinese Sweet and Sour Fish Recipe.**

**Chinese style sweet and sour fish recipe adapted from Chef Martin Yan.**

Lets do some Chinese take out dinner. Who doesn't love fish, fried and tossed
in sauce. Come with me…I will give you a piggyback to flavor town. I adapted
this recipe from Martin Yan's cooking show, Yan can cook. I love all things
Martin Yan. He is cute, he makes me laugh and he makes good food. The fish
turned out awesome. Today was good. Today was fun. Tomorrow is another one.

So here is the route to flavor town.  

First lets make the batter to fry the fish.  
Crack one egg in a bowl. You are doing it right if your egg has an yellow
yolk. To the egg add half a teaspoon each of salt and pepper powder. Add in
1/4 cup of corn starch and half a teaspoon of soy sauce. Stir well.  

Add in the cut fish fillet and mix well to combine.  

Let the batter marinate for 15-20 minutes. Add oil to a pan for frying the
fish. When the oil is hot,add the fish to the pan and cook till they are
lightly browned.About 2 minutes. Lift out and drain on paper towels. Set
aside. In the mean time, if you are like me, nibble on the fried fish. Promise
me you wont be like me.  

Now for the stir-fry and the sauce  
Make a corn starch slurry by adding a tablespoon of cornstarch to 1/4 cup of
water. set aside.  
  
  
Heat a table spoon of oil in a skillet. When shimmering add in the chopped
garlic and fry till they start to brown. Add in the chopped onion and the
sliced red peppers/capsicum. Briefly fry for a minute. Now add in the sauce
mixture (honey,soy and vinegar). I used apple cider vinegar as that's what I
had. If you have rice vinegar use it dearies. Simmer for a minute. Now is the
time to thicken the sauce. Add the corn starch slurry to the pan and saute for
10 seconds.  
  
The sauce will become thick in an instant. Add in the fried fish and toss
slightly to coat. Add the spring onions/scallions. Toss it around so the fish
gets evenly coated with the sauce. Remove off heat.  
  
Serve hot with rice or noodles.

When someone writes an paragraph he/she keeps the idea of  
a user in his/her brain that how a user can be  
aware of it. Therefore that's why this post is amazing.  
Thanks!
