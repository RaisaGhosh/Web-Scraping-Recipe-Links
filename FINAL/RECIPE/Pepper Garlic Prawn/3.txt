  * 15 cloves Garlic , finely chopped 
  * 1/2 Lemon juice
  * 1/2 teaspoon Rock Salt

## How to make Butter Garlic Prawns Recipe

  1. To begin making the Butter Garlic Prawns recipe, sprinkle some salt over the cleaned prawns and keep them aside.

  2. Heat up a skillet or a flat surface pan and add olive oil + butter into it. Olive oil saves the butter from burning.

  3. Once the butter gets melted, then add chopped garlic into it. Keep it cooking still you start getting the aroma of garlic.

  4. Next, add the seasoned prawns into it and cook for 2-3 minutes on low heat.

  5. Now add red chilli flakes, rock salt and black pepper powder into the prawns and mix everything properly. 

  6. Now cover the pan and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Check if prawns have cooked properly.

  7. Once prawns are ready, check the salt and turn off the stove. Add the lemon juice into the prawns and give it a good mix again. Garnish it with fresh coriander leaves and serve. 

  8. Serve Butter Garlic Prawns as a side dish along with Prawn Coconut Curry and Rice for a weekday meal.
