## Ingredients required

To make instant ramen with vegetables, you need the following ingredients:

  1. Instant noodles: discard the seasoning
  2. Mushrooms: I have used button mushrooms. You can use any type of mushroom you prefer.
  3. Carrot
  4. Bell pepper: Any color
  5. Broccoli
  6. Onion
  7. Spring onion: Bok choy or spinach can be used too
  8. Chili pepper: I have used Thai red chili, use whichever hot chili pepper is available to you.
  9. Ginger
  10. Garlic
  11. Brown sugar: I prefer dark brown sugar and would recommend using it. You can also use light brown sugar, palm sugar, or normal white sugar
  12. Vegetarian oyster sauce: Vegetarian oyster sauce is made with oyster mushrooms. If you can find a vegan version it's even better.
  13. Soy sauce: Use dark soy sauce in this recipe
  14. Sesame oil: It gives a nice nutty flavor to Asian dishes. Make sure not to add a lot of sesame oil to your recipe otherwise, the dish will start tasting bitter.
  15. Vegetable oil

## How to make vegetarian ramen from scratch?

Making this vegetarian ramen is very simple. It takes less than 25 minutes to
get ready from start to finish. Just follow the following simple steps:

  1. Mince garlic, chop ginger, and spring onion, and cut medium-sized florets of broccoli. Thinly slice all the other vegetables and mushrooms. This is the only time taking step in this recipe. Once your vegetables are chopped, the remaining steps will get ready within a few minutes.
  2. Heat oil in a pan. Add onion, garlic, ginger, and spring onion white. Saute until the onion turns translucent.
  3. Next, add mushrooms. Saute until it's moisture gets evaporated.
  4. Add carrot, broccoli, bell pepper, and red chili pepper. Saute until the vegetables are cooked but still crunchy.
  5. In a bowl mix soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and brown sugar. Add it to the pan. Saute with the vegetables for about a minute.
  6. Push the vegetables towards the corner with the help of a spatula and create space at the center. Pour vegetable stock at the center and let it simmer.
  7. Put the instant noodles on top of simmering stock and let it remain like that until it becomes soft from one side. You can cover the pan to fasten the process.
  8. Flip the noodles over and cook the other side until it turns soft too.
  9. Add spring onion green and mix everything. 
  10. Cook for another 2 minutes and then enjoy!

## How to make it spicy?

The vegetable ramen recipe which I have shared here is not very spicy. But if
you love hot & spicy vegetarian ramen and want to make that just add a few
teaspoons of chili oil or any hot sauce of your choice.

You can add more chopped chili peppers to the dish for extra heat.

Another way of making spicy vegetable ramen is to use a pack of spicy instant
noodles and adding it's seasoning to the sauce mix.

## How to make vegan ramen?

Almost every ingredient used in this recipe is vegan. However, I could not
make it vegan because I couldn't find vegan oyster sauce in the market.

But you can easily find vegetarian oyster sauce which is made with oyster
mushrooms. I use this brand of vegetarian oyster sauce and it's very good.

Though all the ingredients mentioned in the sauce bottle are vegan, they have
labeled it as vegetarian and not vegan. So, I am calling my vegetable ramen
vegetarian not vegan.

If you want to create a vegan version of this dish, either try to find a vegan
version of oyster sauce or replace it with any other Asian stir fry sauce of
your choice.

## Variation suggestions

You can create different delicious versions of this easy ramen recipe. I have
used the vegetables that were available to me. You can also add cabbage, peas,
tofu, bean sprouts, bok choy, and other varieties of mushrooms.

For a fancier dish, you can add some toppings to your ramen bowl. Some ramen
topping suggestions are given below:

  * Roasted peanuts
  * Fried onion
  * Fried garlic
  * Chili flakes
  * Bean sprouts
  * Fried/ baked tofu
  * Fried noodle strands
  * Toasted sesame seeds
  * Spring onion
  * Fresh coriander leaves
  * Seaweed
  * Fried/ boiled eggs if you are not vegan
