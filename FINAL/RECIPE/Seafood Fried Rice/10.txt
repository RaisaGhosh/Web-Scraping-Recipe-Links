# Shrimp Fried Rice Recipe

Jump to Recipe Print Recipe

I am a fan of Fried Rice. One version that I like most is the Filipino Fried
Rice (sinangag). Yang Chow Fried Rice and Adobo Fried Rice are also on the top
of my favorite fried rice list. Our featured fried rice recipe, Shrimp Fried
Rice, is also something that I often make for breakfast or lunch when I have
tiny shrimp available.

This Shrimp Fried Rice Recipe makes use of little frozen shrimp. I like to use
these types of shrimp because these are tastier compared to the larger
varieties. I also like the idea that these are cheaper, most of the time.
Shrimp fried rice also makes use of frozen green peas, carrots, and butter.

Preparing Shrimp Fried Rice is quick and easy. I use leftover white rice if I
can, and I make sure that the rice variety is not sticky; long grain rice
works best for me. I simple mash the rice gently using my hands and add some
garlic, onion powder and some salt. Instead of using oil, I use butter for
this recipe.

Butter is an important ingredient for shrimp fried rice, but you have to
understand that there is a proper way to handle butter so that it can be in
harmony with the other ingredients. Butter should also be cooked in low to
medium heat to prevent it from getting burnt. The peas and carrots are great
additions that make this fried rice dish taste and look better.
