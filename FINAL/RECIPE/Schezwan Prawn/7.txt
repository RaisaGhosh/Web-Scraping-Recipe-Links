Excellent recipe! (with just a few suggestions).  
To me, most of the the time, less is more.  
I get really disgusted with Asian Restaurants that think it is OK to drown out
a great dish with mushy vegetables! So don’t overdo this dish with too many
different veggies!  
First off, prep this well ahead of time. It will save you a lot of stress and
aid you in the enjoyment of fixing this and enjoying it!  
I used green and red peppers, diced green onions, quartered white onions and
asparagus tips for my veggies. Also, making the sauce ahead of time is a great
benefit as the ingredients tend to meld and enhance the flavors. The Chinese
five spice is a must and if you have Szechwan peppercorns use them! They will
add that exotic flavor every great cook wants in a dish like this. (I ordered
mine from Amazon).  
My sauce was made from fresh garlic, fresh Ginger, a dash of red pepper
flakes, Rice vinegar, soy sauce, siracha, Brown sugar and Chinese five spice.
(I also added 1/2 cup of chicken broth and a teaspoon of corn starch to
thicken. I set aside the sauce for several hours in the fridge.  
In my opinion, this recipe did not provide enough sauce to adequately coat the
ingredients and make a complete and thoroughly tasty dish. (I always enjoy
more sauce than not enough!). I fixed Jasmine rice ahead of time and reheated
it before serving.  
The Shrimp were cooked first in peanut oil and set aside. With the remaining
oil and juice from the shrimp, I added fresh garlic for a minute, added the
peppers and onions and asparagus, (stir fried for one minute),  
Then put the shrimp back in and added the chopped green onions. Add the
prepared sauce and stir-fry for another minute. Caution; do NOT overcook the
vegetables! If you do, they will lose color, flavor and crunch!  
Garnish with remaining chopped green onions and serve Steaming hot. Enjoy!
