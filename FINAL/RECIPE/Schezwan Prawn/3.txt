## Szechwan Prawns

__April 30, 2015 / __Mareena Jerrish / / __Print /





J is not a big fan of Chinese cuisine. Hence, I usually avoid preparing them
when he is around. Today was one of those days. J had mentioned that he won't
be joining us for lunch or dinner. So I went ahead and prepared fried rice and
Szechwan Prawns, after a long gap. We had just finished our lunch when J
called up and informed that he was on his way home. I was a bit apprehensive
while serving food to him. But my joy knew no bounds when he asked for a
second helping. Yipppee !!! Little pleasures of lifeâ€¦Doing the happy dance ðŸ™‚
