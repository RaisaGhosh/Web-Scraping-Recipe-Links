# Steamed Chicken with Shiitake Mushroom (È¶ôËèáËí∏È∏°)

  *   *   *   * 

Jump to Recipe

_Tender, succulent and fragrant, Chinese steamed chicken with shiitake
mushrooms requires little effort to cook yet it tastes amazing. A classic dish
for both everyday meals and special occasions._

Don‚Äôt miss today‚Äôs dish, steamed chicken with shiitake mushroom (È¶ôËèáËí∏È∏°) if you
‚ë† enjoy chicken (and mushrooms); ‚ë° are looking for a healthy but tasty dish; ‚ë¢
want to cook something really easy.

It‚Äôs a perfect choice for several reasons:

  * The steaming method preserves the freshness and tenderness of the chicken while bringing out the umami flavour from shiitake mushrooms.
  * There is no frying involved so there is no extra fat used and no grease left in your kitchen.
  * The cooking process couldn‚Äôt be simpler: Mix all the ingredients and leave to steam. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a dish that‚Äôs hard to fail!

## Ingredients

### Chicken

The traditional Chinese steamed chicken often uses chunky pieces of chicken
that have the skin on and bones in. I use skinless, boneless chicken thighs
which are my favourite cut. They are tender and very flavoursome thanks to a
moderate amount of fat.

Mid-joint chicken wings are a great alternative if you enjoy the flavourful
skin.

### Shiitake mushroom

A popular type of mushroom in Chinese cuisine, shiitake mushrooms develop a
unique aroma when dried. They lend meat-based dishes, such as Lion‚Äôs Head
Meatballs, Dumpling Fillings, a wonderful fragrance.

For today‚Äôs steamed chicken, I highly recommend you used dried shiitake
mushroom, instead of fresh ones or other types of mushrooms, which definitely
contribute to the overall flavour of the dish.

Remember to soak them in water overnight (or until soften) before you start
cooking.

### Seasonings

Here is the list of ingredient used to marinate the chicken.

  * Light & dark soy sauce. The combination of two types of soy sauce is recommended. The dark version gives the dish a beautiful brown shine and a hint of caramelised flavour.
  * Oyster sauce. If you‚Äôre allergic to seafood, use vegetarian oyster sauce which is known as ‚Äúmushroom vegetarian stir-fry sauce/Á¥†È£üËöùÊ≤π‚Äù.
  * Shaoxing rice wine. Omit it if you‚Äôd like an alcohol-free dish.
  * Sesame oil
  * Ground white pepper
  * Corn starch, or tapioca starch, potato starch
  * Ginger

### An extra kick

Adding fresh chili is my personal twist to this classic dish. It gives the
palate a nice kick which I like very much. However, please feel free to skip
it if you wish.

## Cooking procedure

As I mentioned earlier, it takes only two very simple steps to cook this dish:

### Step 1: Marinate the chicken

  * Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces then mix with all the seasoning ingredients in a bowl. Leave to marinate for 10 mins or so.
  * While waiting, prepare the rehydrated shiitake mushrooms. Trim off the hard stem then half them if you‚Äôre using big ones, or keep them whole if small.

### Step 2: Steam the dish

  * Add shiitake mushroom and chilies to the chicken and mix well. Transfer everything into a serving plate. 
  * Steam over medium heat for 20 minutes (count from the moment when water starts boiling). 
  * Sprinkle some finely chopped scallions and you‚Äôre ready to serve!

## Steaming tips

As shown in the images above, I use a traditional bamboo steamer basket set in
a wok. Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt have the same equipment! Here are two
alternative solutions:

  * Put a steamer rack into a wok/large pot then place the plate on top.
  * Or use a small bowl to support the plate.

Either way, you‚Äôll need to make sure the wok/pot can be covered properly with
a lid for steaming.

**Another tip:**  Use a deep plate (rather than a flat one) to hold the
chicken as quite a bit of liquid will be extracted during steaming. Yet, do
not crowd the chicken in a bowl since it‚Äôll take longer to cook through all of
the pieces.

### Instructions

#### Marinate the chicken

  * Put chicken pieces into a mixing bowl. Add all the ingredients for the chicken. Mix well then leave to marinate for 10 mins or so.

#### Steam the dish

  * Add shiitake mushroom and chilies to the chicken. Mix then transfer to a deep plate (see note 3).

  * Bring water to a full boil in a wok/pot. Place in the chicken plate to steam using one of the following set-ups: in a steamer basket, over a steamer rack or a small bowl.

  * Steam over medium heat for 20 mins. Garnish with scallions and serve immediately.

### NOTES

1\. I like skinless, boneless chicken thighs for this dish as they‚Äôre easy to
cook through and very flavourful. Mid-joint wings are a great choice too.

2\. Dried shiitake mushroom provides a key umami flavour to the dish so I
don‚Äôt recommend you replace them with fresh mushrooms. Soak them in water
overnight until they become soft.

3\. Do not use a shallow plate as quite a lot of liquid will be extracted from
the chicken during steaming. Also, do not use a bowl as it would take a longer
time to cook through the chicken.

Yay Wei - another easy yet delicious and wholesome recipe. Made this last
night. I used boned in thighs though and added a dash of shaoxing wine just
before serving. The chicken was so fragrant, tender and flavourful. Everyone
loved it! And i‚Äôm keeping the leftover gravy for a simple noodles lunchüòä

Happy to know you enjoyed it Sharon! I sometimes save the thickened sauce too.
So yummy! It would be a pity to discard it.

Very easy and very, very delicious recipe! I used a few more peppers but
fortunately we like hot dishes. I plan to bring the dish to a small gathering
and will use less peppers. Thank you, Wei, for always making my life easier!

Great recipe for when one doesnt feel like cooking. I added some extra woodear
and lily so I also almost doubled the marinade ingredients. Really enjoyed the
chili - I felt it really lifted the dish. Thanks so much!!!

This Steamed Chicken with Shitake Mushroom is so delicious and very flavorful!
I used Manjo Aji Mirin that I bought from Karman Foods, as an alternative and
it's perfect!

Hi, I was wondering what size the bamboo steamer is here, and so a rough
estimate for the size of the dish. Thank you.

The inner circle of my steamer basket measures about 25cm (10 inches) in
diameter.

This looks very delicious, and wonderfully simple! Are all measurements in
teaspoons (5ml)? I wondered if it should be with tablespoons (15ml) for the
oyster sauce, soy sauces and cooking wine. They look like different measures
in the picture. I'm going to make it now üòÉ

Do you cover the plate when steaming?

Reply

    * Wei @ Red House Spice says

March 09, 2021 at 10:19 pm

You would need to cover the steamer with a lid but don't need to cover the
plate itself.
