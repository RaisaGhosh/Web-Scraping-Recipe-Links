Slurrp is a recipe aggregator that helps one find recipes based on one's diet
choices, fitness goals and taste preferences. It provides calorie-counted
recipes across cuisines and meals types and caters to all levels of cooking
skills -- from a beginner to an expert. It also offers a nutrimeter that
calculates the precise nutrient intake based on the user's height and weight
to recommend recipes for each meal. Once youâve shortlisted recipes that you
want to prepare, you can also add them to your Meal Plan which pins your
recipes on the calendar so you can plan your meals in advance.
