 **Cup corn recipe or Buttered corn recipe -** American sweet corn is mixed
with butter, salt and pepper. It is flavored with Chaat masala.

Monsoon season is already started in India. This is the right time when butta
and american corns are in season. So I thought of sharing corn recipes on the
blog. Though we still have summer going on here in states.

Today I am sharing the basic yet delicious, plain buttered cup corn. The
buttery flavors goes perfect with American sweet corns. This is my favorite
one, while hubby prefers the spicy version over mild flavors.

In India, There are many stalls that serve buttered cup corn. These stalls are
usually in the mall, theater and many public places. They serve many different
flavor versions.

or Jump to Recipe

1) First boil the corn cob. Break the whole corn into two, so it fits into
pressure cooker. Take into the cooker with water. There should be enough
water, so corn is submerged into the water. Pressure cook it for 3-4 whistles
on medium heat. Turn off the stove, let the pressure go down by itself. Then
open the lid. Remove the corn and let it cool to touch.

2) Once it is cool, Remove the corn kernels. You can do it by hand. Or Hold
the corn vertically and run the knife near the cob. I prefer the second
method.

3) Add butter, salt, pepper, chaat masala. Also squeeze the lemon juice.

4) Mix everything well. Make sure the butter is coated evenly to the kernels.

Remove it to a serving bowl.

**_Serving suggestion:_** Serve as a snack any time of the day.  
_**Notes:**_

  * Here I have used fresh corn. But you can use frozen bag of corn kernels. If so then boil them in the water on stovetop or microwave.
  * Or you can use canned corn kernels as well. Just drain the liquid and use them in the recipe.
  * In this buttered corn recipe, I have added chaat masala to add some more flavors. Instead of chaat masala you can flavor it up by using herbs like dried or fresh basil or Italian herbs or freshly chopped cilantro or parsley or mint leaves.
  * Or skip the flavoring ingredient entirely. Enjoy plain sweet corn just with butter, salt and pepper.
