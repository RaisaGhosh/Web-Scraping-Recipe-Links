_How many of you know that soft, creamy Indian cottage cheese known as Paneer?
If youâ€™ve been frequenting Indian restaurants, the chances of you coming
across this famous and popular Indian staple in their dishes is quite high._

_Iâ€™m going to introduce you to this easy stir fried veggie + paneer in spiced
onion tomato sauce. It turns into absolute fabulousness. This paneer jalfrezi
is my first choice to make whenever I lay my hands on some chunk of paneer._

## What is Paneer?

Paneer, aka Indian cottage cheese, is a fresh, creamy, normally unsalted
cheese. Itâ€™s made by curdling hot milk with lemon/lime juice or vinegar. The
result is a soft, fluffy cheese that is firm and can be cut into blocks or
cubes.

The texture is usually similar to that of firm tofu. It retains its firmness
when cooked over high heat and thatâ€™s why itâ€™s a very popular add-in for many
Indian dishes.

It enhances any dish with its rich, creamy presence and absorbs all the
flavors and spices. It's a vegetarianâ€™s favorite source of protein.

## What is Paneer Jalfrezi?

Jalfrezi is one of the most popular curries served in Indian restaurants
worldwide. It could be made with chicken, lamb, shrimp, just veggies, or in
this case with paneer and veggies together.

It's semi dry, spicy and tangy. Jalfrezi is Indiaâ€™s version of a stir fry dish
where vegetables, meat (if using any) or paneer is all cooked together in
thick tangy, spicy onion-tomato sauce.

It is believed to have originated in West Bengal and is now popular all over,
especially in Britain where the curry houses make this spicy tangy curry
famous.

Jalfrezi comes from the words Jal, meaning spicy food, and frezi, meaning
suitable for diet.

Today I am going meatless and presenting you this paneer jalfrezi, where
paneer is THE STAR.

## This is what you need for this quick stir fry, Indian style

  1. **Paneer -** You can very easily get paneer in any Indian grocery store, mostly in their refrigerated section.
  2.  **Veggies - **Onions, tomatoes, tomato puree, bell peppers (I use multiple colors, it adds more color to the dish).
  3.  **Aromatics -** Garlic, ginger and cilantro.
  4.  **Spices -** Turmeric, Kashmiri red chili powder (you can use paprika in its absence), coriander powder, cumin seeds (jeera), dry whole chilies (optional).
  5.  **Salt**
  6.  **Oil or ghee**

## This is going to go very fast, making this Paneer Jalfreziâ€¦

Like any stir fry, you need to do a lot of chopping in the beginning and from
then it's a breeze.

I love my veggies in strips or slices for this recipe, rather than chopping
everything into cubes. Cut onions, tomato, bell peppers in strips. Slice
garlic and chop ginger into juliennes.

Heat oil or ghee in a pan and add in cumin seeds. Cook until they start to
pop, about a minute. Add in onion and whole chilis, broken into pieces, and
sautÃ©. You can skip these chilies if youâ€™re looking for a milder version. Once
the onions are soft, add in garlic and sautÃ© for a minute.

Time to add bell peppers along with all the spices and salt. Mix well and cook
for 2-3 minutes on high heat.

Stir in tomato puree along with ginger and cook for another couple of minutes.
You want the bell peppers to be a little soft but to still hold the crunch.

Add in tomato slices along with paneer strips and toss everything well. Cook
for 2-3 minutes till the paneer gets a little soft.

Stir in cilantro and toss everything well. Thatâ€™s itâ€¦ This super duper stir
fry is ready to serve. You will be amazed how many flavors develop with just a
few Indian pantry staples.

## What to serve this with?

  * It's mostly eaten with rotis or some great flaky parathas or naan breads.
  * You can make it a little saucier by adding a little water and serve it over rice.
  * I can see leftovers going great in between some hot pita pockets or rolled in tortillas like a burrito.
  * Low carbers can use cauliflower rice or low carb tortillas.

## Some Variations

  1. Try using other veggies like mushrooms, baby corn, green beans or cauliflower. All will be great in this onion-tomato based sauce.
  2. Add a little kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) in the end. This comes in a box in Indian grocery stores. It's a great flavor enhancer.
  3. You can make it saucier by increasing the amount of tomato puree and a little water.
  4. Vegans can replace paneer with tofu.

## Can I make homemade paneer?

Yes, sure you can. Thatâ€™s what I do most of the time here in the States. It's
extremely easy to make it in your very own kitchen.

Try making it with full fat whole milk. Boil a gallon of milk in a large pot.
Stir regularly to avoid burning the milk on the bottom of the pot. Once the
milk is boiling, add 1/4 cup of lemon or lime juice and keep on stirring with
a spoon. The milk will start curdling right away, separating the whey.

Line a strainer or colander with two layers of cheesecloth or clean muslin
cloth. Dump in the curds. Rinse it with cold water. This cools the cheese and
helps wash away the excess lemon juice.

After this, gather the cheesecloth by the corners and start squeezing it to
remove the excess liquid. Be careful to not burn your hands in case it's still
hot. Keep squeezing it until the cheese is firm and no more liquid comes out
easily.

Flatten the cheese in the cheesecloth and fold the edges over the cheese and
put it on a plate. Then put a second plate on top and weigh it down with
several cans of food or a pot or anything heavy.

Let it sit on the counter top for a couple of hours. This step helps press out
any more liquid and make it firm. After a couple of hours, your paneer is
ready to useâ€¦ ðŸ™‚

Fresh paneer will be good in the fridge for 2-3 days. Some people store it
submerged in water in a container to keep it soft.

## Storing leftovers

Paneer jalfrezi can be stored in an airtight container for up to 2-3 days.
Just reheat when ready to eat. We donâ€™t recommend freezing this, as like with
any other stir fry it's best served fresh.

Well my friends, I have given you an excellent meatless night option. All you
need is that yum creamy paneer in your home to make this amazing popular dish
from India. Make your very own paneer or make a quick round to your Indian
store to grab some. From there, it happens in a breeze. Have fun curryingâ€¦
