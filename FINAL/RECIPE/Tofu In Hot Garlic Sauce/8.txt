# Fish Fragrant Tofu-Tofu in Hot Garlic Sauce

**_Fish fragrant tofu (Yu Xiang Tofu)_ **or Chinese fish flavor tofu is tofu
stir-fried with a Szechuan style hot sweet and sour sauce. It is commonly
named as Sichuan hot garlic sauce in restaurant. It is one of most popular
homemade tofu recipe from Sichuan Cuisine. And this 15 minutes dish is
absolutely a perfect match with steamed rice. The fish fragrant sauce can help
me eat up two large bowls of boring steamed rice.

_**It is very interesting this Yu Xiang, or fish fragrant sauce has no fish is
this dish at all.**_ There are two versions about the name. One saying is the
sauce is usually used to cook fish at the very beginning, then it is further
cooked with other ingredients including pork, eggplant, egg and tofu, so all
dishes with this particular sauce is named as "Yu Xiang" dishes. The second
saying is coming from the pickled peppers. Traditionally, fish is added in the
jar of the pickled peppers, consequently the peppers are loaded with fish
flavor. Since pickled pepper is used in this sauce, it is named after the
flavor.

Tofu is always on the top of my ingredients. I love to drink soy milk and eat
Mapo tofu very much. Fish fragrant sauce or yu shiang sauce (È±ºÈ¶ô) is a famous
flavor in Sichuan cuisine. And there are other dishes which are quite famous
the taste including fragrant eggplant, you can check the recipe here Yu Xiang
eggplant and the famous fish fragrant shredded pork or Yuxiang Rousi(È±ºÈ¶ôËÇâ‰∏ù).

Ingredients for Yu Xiang Sauce is similar to Mapo tofu using garlic, ginger,
scallion, sugar, vinegar and chili paste. The differences are the seasoning
ratio and the pickled peppers. Overall this is a sweet and sour sauce with a
soft spice flavor. Even with a faint change, the flavors can be different,
that's the key cooking concept of real Sichuan cuisine.

Yu Xiang flavor can be vegan friendly by skipping the mince pork. But if you
are not on vegan diet, I highly recommend adding some mince pork, with a very
small amount, it can improve the flavor greatly.

### Instructions

Add tofu into thick strips and then coat with cornstarch.

In a pan, add oil and fry tofu until crispy and golden brown.

Fry mince pork until crispy and slightly browned and then add doubanjiang and
pickled pepper to fry until the oil turns red.

Then add garlic, ginger and scallion, fry until aromatic. Place the sauce in.
Simmer for 2-3 minutes until the sauce is well thickened. Add tofu strips in,
mix to coat each strip with Yu Xiang sauce.

Haha Tam,

Nice question!!! Really. There are lots of interesting Chinese dish names that
are quite confusing. For this one, the sauce was firstly used to cook fish in
family houses in Sichuan province. Then the sauce is further developed as a
flavor, used on many other dishes like fish-fragrant tofu, fish-fragrant
eggplant etc. And they are extremely popular in China now.

Thank you for this recipe. When I lived in Chongqing, È±ºÈ¶ôËÇâ‰∏ù and È±ºÈ¶ôËåÑÂ≠ê were my
favorites! Now I'm vegan, and back in the US, and I wanted to see if I could
make the dish with tofu. I have some È±ºÈ¶ôËÇâ‰∏ùË∞ÉÊñô a friend in China sent me, but it
has far too many calories and I'm not sure why... maybe too much oil? Anyway,
I'll try your recipe and use some Ë±ÜÁì£ÈÖ± to enhance the taste.

Hello Elaine,  
thank you for the many wonderful recipes on your website. üôÇ I was wondering if
you use a special kind of wine and vinegar in this recipe or if any kind will
do. Thank you.

Karin,  
I use very basic Chinese shaoxing wine and black vinegar.

Your use of very basic ingredients has transformed my own Chinese cooking. I
don't follow recipes closely, only to review ingredients. Your philosophy, to
cook simply instead of buying sauces at the store, has really helped me to
understand your foods. The only sauce I still purchase is toban djan (but I
mean to make it from scratch after seeing your recipe). Thank you so much for
your wonderful way of thinking about food!

Mike,  
I feel so happy to read your comment because you really understand my points.
I get complains from my friends outside China saying that no matter where they
go, the dishes tastes almost the same in different areas and restaurants.
Which should not be the fact for Chinese food because most of the chef does
not use recipes, they cook based on personal experience and understanding
about ingredients, sauces and rations. So dishes from different chef should be
different in Chinese cuisine. The modernized cooking uses lots of all purpose
sauce or store bought sauce, those sauce kill the possibility of advanced
flavors totally. So I decided to share how I make my food using very basic
ingredients.

I tried the recipe and my husband (being Asian and very skeptical about Asian
recipes online) actually loved it as well. The only alteration was adding
ground pork and using frozen Thai red peppers instead of pickling peppers.
This gave a more spicy kick, but it was so yummy. I love fish tofu and this
was a very simple and quick recipe to make for dinner.

Thanks Vue for the feedback. I use fresh Thai peppers for this dish from time
to time too.

This was really great and pretty easy to make. Do you recommend using sweet
potato starch to coat the tofu along with using in the sauce?

You can use any type of starch for coating.

Hello there,

There was another y√ªxi√†ng d√≤ufu recipe before this, but now I can't find it.
It was a braised tofu dish I think? Is it possible to find it in the archives
possibly?

Thank you,  
Tavya

I made this tonight with homemade tofu. I substituted minced mushrooms for the
pork (since I don't eat meat) but kept everything else exactly the same, and
it's one of the best things I've made OR eaten in a while! thank you so much
for your excellent recipes.

I made this for dinner tonight using mushrooms instead of pork and a different
vinegar than chinese black vinegar, but it was still delicious! I'm trying to
eat more vegetarian food so this will definitely go into the rotation!
