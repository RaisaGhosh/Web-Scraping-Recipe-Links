We love soups and I used to make soups everyday when my DH's late Grandpa
lived with us for around 2 years. SO I have made this soup and with great
success. MY recipe is more or less the same but I add spinach (i love it) and
and cabbage and not the bamboo shoots. (will try it now) I even have used bean
sprouts. Keep changing the combination of vegetables depending on what's
available. Garnish with burnt (browned in oil and patted dry) garlic and
chopped cilantro for a change.
