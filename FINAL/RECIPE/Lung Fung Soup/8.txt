###  Lung Fung Soup/ Chinese Vegetarian Soup

Lung fung soup or Dragon phoenix soup, is a thick seafood or gou rou soup made
with lemon, chili peppers, and Chinese vegetables. Other variations could
include a vegetarian version of the same with mushrooms instead of seafood.
Fung probably comes from the use of mushrooms in the soup. (Source: Wikipedia)
