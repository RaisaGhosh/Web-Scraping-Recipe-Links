# Green Beans in Dill Walnut Sauce

Jump to Recipe \- Print Recipe

  *   *   * 

I knew this recipe for Green Beans in Dill Walnut Sauce was going to be a
family favorite when the first time I made it, it almost didn't get to the
table before sticky fingers were eating it up. And what an easy way to dress
up plain green beans when served warm for a fresh side dish or serve chilled
as a salad replacement. Get creative and mix in some zucchini, red peppers and
quinoa for a meatless main dish.

The dill walnut sauce tastes incredibly fresh, blending olive oil with fresh
lemon juice, scallions, dill, parsley and walnuts. Creamed together quickly in
the food processor or blender, this deliciously light tasting yet creamy sauce
can substitute for salad dressing in other dishes as well.

And this dish pairs great with grilled chicken recipes or fish, but also adds
a light compliment to beef.

### Ingredients

1x2x3x

  * 3 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed
  * 1 bunch scallions, white bulbs and green stalks, rough diced
  * 1 bunch fresh dill, chopped
  * ½ cup minced fresh parsley
  * ½ cup walnut halves
  * ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
  * 1 ½ cup olive oil
  * Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
  * Cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced as you like

### Instructions

  * Heat a large pot of water to boiling. Add the green beans and boil until crisp-tender. Drain immediately, then immerse in a large bowl of ice water to prevent further cooking and to retain bright green color. Set aside.

  * For the sauce: Place the scallions, dill, parsley, walnuts, and lemon juice in a food processor or blender; process until smooth. With the machine running, pour the olive oil in a thin steady stream through the feed tube to make a thick green sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste.

  * Drain the beans and dry with paper towel. Todd the beans with the dressing in a mixing bowl. Add the cherry tomatoes for a beautiful color contrast. Transfer the beans to a flat serving bowl.

  * Serve slightly chilled or at room temperature.
