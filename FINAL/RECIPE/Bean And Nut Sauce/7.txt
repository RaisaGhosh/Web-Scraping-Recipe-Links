Thick, creamy, and full of flavor, these green beans and potatoes are served
in a peanut sauce with a hint of Asian flavor. The sauce is made from creamy
peanut butter combined with sesame oil and sweet chili oil, then topped with
chopped peanuts for extra crunch. The potatoes are soft and tender, the beans
are tender-crisp, and the dish is perfect served over a bed of quinoa.
