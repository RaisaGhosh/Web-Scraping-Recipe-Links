# Beans in Peanut Sauce

Iâ€™m not normally a fan of French beans, but I invariably pick up these beans
because they look so green and fresh that I just cant walk away before buying
atleast a quarter kilo of them. Recently, I tasted a curry made with these
beans at one of my friends place and decided to make it a regular everyday
curry at our home. There are certain recipes which bring out the flavor of the
vegetable being cooked, taste as though its one of the most exotic foods ever.

Very easy, quick to prepare and not to mention delicious, this recipe involves
the preparation of a paste with roasted peanuts, coriander seeds, cumin,
cardamom and cinnamon which is combined with steamed beans and sauted onions.
These beans in peanut sauce make for a wonderful curry with both rice and
rotis. A delectable combination.
