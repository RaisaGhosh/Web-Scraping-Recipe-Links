#  Korean crispy lamb

16 February 2017/2 Comments/in BLOG, Meat, Pasta, rice and noodles, RECIPES
/by Becky

I'm not sure if you've noticed, but Korean food is having a bit of a moment.
It's not a cuisine I've really explored but I keep reading about it, and it
turns out that Korean food is really healthy and colourful, with lots of
vegetables and simply cooked, good quality meat forming the basis of many
dishes. I tried a Korean crispy lamb recipe from Simply Beef and Lamb, and
it's so easy, it can be on the table in about twenty minutes. This dish uses
Gochujang (Korean chilli paste), which I was initially a bit worried about
tracking down, but it turns out you can buy it in Waitrose and loads of places
online. If you can't find any, just use any other punchy chilli paste. As
usual when choosing lamb, I always look out for a quality mark like the Red
Tractor logo – I need to know that it’s responsibly produced, and the logo
tells you that you're buying farm assured, quality meat).  

**Korean crispy lamb**

Ingredients:

1 large pack lamb mince

2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed

3 tbsp Korean chilli paste (Gochujang) or other hot chilli paste

2 tbsp soy sauce

2 tbsp rice wine vinegar

Salt and pepper

300g rice or udon noodles

Spiralised vegetables: I used 300g each of courgette and butternut squash

Juice of 1 lime

2-3 spring onions, finely chopped

Sweet chilli sauce, to serve

In a large bowl, mix together the lamb, garlic, chilli paste, soy sauce and
rice wine vinegar. Season well.

Heat a large non-stick frying pan until really hot, then dry fry the mince for
15 minutes on a high heat, turning occasionally and breaking up the clumps
with the back of a wooden spoon.

Meanwhile put the noodles in a large bowl, cover with boiling water and set
aside for 2-3 minutes until soft. Drain and set aside.

Add the spiralised vegetables and drained noodles to the pan with the mince
(add the harder ones like carrot first). Season if required, add the lime or
lemon juice and toss gently to mix.

Garnish with the spring onions and serve with a dash of chilli sauce.

So delicious and easy! You can even buy ready-spiralised vegetables if you're
feeling lazy.

For this recipe, and for loads of other inspirational recipes, check out the
selection of Korean recipes on Simply Beef and Lamb's website. We're going to
try the classic beef bibimbap next.

  * About Hungry BeckyI’m a 40 year old mum and I work at home developing and testing recipes for magazines and recipe books, and writing about food and travel. I also write for readyforten.com and travel blog havealovelytime.com. I am an excessive twitterer (tweeter?), a bit blonde, a bit of a nerd, an occasional hysteric and the most unsporty person on the planet (I was the one round the back of the bike sheds having a fag during PE) and, apart from a small group of my very close and adored friends, am rather unsociable (I like my own company – possibly a throwback from hours spent fielding in the sea during childhood beach cricket games: ‘go deep! No, deeper!’). I can jabber for England and can be lured anywhere with something pink and sparkly or anything that smells nice. I am married with two sons: #1: our oldest son (the mad scientist of the family – he’s 15, sings like an angel, strums a mean guitar, reads books faster than that bloke off Criminal Minds, has a wit sharper than a razor, is the only tidy person in the whole house and always smells nice too – all fan mail gratefully received) and #2: our very own Death Wish…
