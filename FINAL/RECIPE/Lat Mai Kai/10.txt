Thailand because this sauce can be eaten with everything. Many Thai chefs
reformed _kaeng ranchuan_ to restaurants after it was mentioned by culinary
authority ML Nueang Ninrat, in a memoir explaining her life during the reign
of King Rama V and VI. The people misunderstand about the origin and
preparation of _kaeng ranchuan_ because of famous TV series that do the wrong
method of this dish and make people remember that this is the real _kaeng
ranchuan_ preparation method. So, the real _kaeng ranchuan_ is in ML Ninrat
book "Life in the Palace" she tells how her grandmother, the princess Sabai
Ninrat created this dish. At the end of dinner there was leftovers so she
asked her assistant to separate the meat from chili and basil. Then, she mixed
it into a broth and added leftover of Nam prhrik kapi, so this is called the
real _kaeng ranchuan_.
