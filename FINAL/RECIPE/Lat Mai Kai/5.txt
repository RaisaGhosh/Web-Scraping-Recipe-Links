#  Lockdown Dish: Lat Mai Paneer

It’s a lockdown Saturday evening, “The West Wing” is playing on the
television, and my mind is off to Lat Mai Paneer. Lat Mai Paneer is known by
various names - Dry Chilli Paneer, Dry Schezwan Paneer. But they all mean
paneer dipped in a batter of cornflour and flour, fried till golden brown and
ultimately doused in a mixture of soya sauce, chilli sauce and vinegar.

Indians love paneer. Paneer to the world could mean fresh cheese, but to
Indians it is a go-to dish for every special occasion. This is perhaps the
only Indian cheese. Indians even make this cheese fresh in their homes. Try
making paneer at home. If you can endure the hours in the kitchen, you will
never resort to buying paneer from stores.

Since Indo-Chinese cuisine first took it’s hold in the eastern part of India
(Kolkata), it's akin to the eastern cooking style. If early chinese settlers
would have first settled in Punjab, Indo-Chinese cuisine would have looked
different. It would have had dollops of butter and ghee in the dishes.

Since our local Inchin’s Bamboo Garden restaurant closed years ago, we have
been going to the one in Schaumburg. We are still in a pandemic and the drive
of forty-five minutes to do a curb side pick sounded unappealing, I tried
making Lat Mai Paneer. And, I am happy to inform you that it was a success!

Here’s the recipe for you to try!
