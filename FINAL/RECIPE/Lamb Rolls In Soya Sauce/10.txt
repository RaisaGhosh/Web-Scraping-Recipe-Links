### Ingredients

#### Potstickers:

  * 1 pound Lean Ground Lamb
  * 1 tablespoon Fresh Ginger finely grated
  * ½ cup Red Onion finely diced (½ small onion)
  * 3 Green onions white and green parts, finely chopped
  * 2 tablespoons San-J Tamari
  * 1 tablespoon Sherry
  * 1 Large Egg lightly beaten
  * 32 Small Rice Paper spring roll Wrappers
  * Vegetable Oil

#### Dipping Sauce:

  * 4 tablespoons San-J Tamari
  * 1 tablespoon Rice Vinegar
  * 1 tablespoon Honey
  * 1-2 teaspoons Chili Garlic Sauce

### Directions

#### Potstickers:

  * In a mixing bowl, combine the lamb, ginger, red and green onions, San-J Tamari, sherry, and egg. Mix well.

  * Run one rice paper under cold water until the entire paper is wet. Shake off the excess water and place on a cutting board.

  * Immediately wet another rice paper and place it directly on top of the first rice paper and press down to seal the two together.

  * Place a small bowl (3 to 4 inches in diameter) on top of the rice papers and using a small paring knife, cut around the bowl to make the dumpling wrapper.

  * Place about 1 tablespoon of the lamb mixture on the dumpling wrapper and fold one side over to make a half circle. Gather the edges together and press well to seal.

  * Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.

  * Heat a large skillet with a lid over medium heat. Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan.

  * Working in batches, arrange the dumplings in the pan close to each other but not touching and cook on one side for 3 minutes or until browned.

  * Sprinkle 2 to 3 teaspoons of water over the dumplings and immediately put the lid on the pan. Let steam for 3 minutes. Do not over-cook.

  * Transfer the dumplings to a serving platter. Wipe out the pan and repeat the process until all dumplings are cooked. Serve with dipping sauce.

#### Dipping Sauce:

  * Combine San-J Tamari, rice vinegar, honey, and chili garlic sauce. Serve with potstickers.
