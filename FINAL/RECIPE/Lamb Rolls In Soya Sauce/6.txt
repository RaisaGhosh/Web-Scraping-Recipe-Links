# Lamb Momus with Sweet Chili Sauce  

No of portion: 4, Approximate Duration: 40mins, Cuisine: Indo China.

## **COOKING**  
PROCEDURE

1

Mix all the ingredients for the filling in a bowl and stir fry it in little
oil, and cook till all the natural stock from the lamb evaporates. Keep aside
to cool.

2

Then knead the dough to a soft consistency. Roll out the dough into small
circles and make a Momus basket.

3

Begin with holding the flat circular dough in your hand and putting a
tablespoon of the filling in the middle of the dough.

4

Then you have to fold the two edges of the half circle so that there is no
open edge in your half circle, and the filling is completely enclosed in the
dough. You will now have the basic half-moon shape, and you can make your
Momus pretty by pinching and folding along the curved edge of the half circle.

5

Start at one tip of the half-moon, and fold over a very small piece of the
dough, pinching down.

6

Continue folding and pinching from the starting point, moving along the edge
until you reach the other tip of the half-moon. Now steam the memos in a
steamer or fry them in little oil.

## **For the sweet chili sauce:**

In a hot pan, mix in all the ingredients and simmer on high flame till the
sugar dissolves. Cool and refrigerate, you will see that the mixture has
become thick. Serve with the Momus.
