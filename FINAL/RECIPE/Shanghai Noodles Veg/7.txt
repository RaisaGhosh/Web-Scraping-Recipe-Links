### Preparation

  1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles until al dente. Drain well and set aside.
  2. Place a wok over high heat. When it begins to smoke, add the vegetable oil. When the oil begins to smoke, add the scallions, chives and peppers. Cook, stirring, for 20 seconds. Add the cabbage and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Then push the vegetables up a side of the wok.
  3. Quickly transfer the cooked noodles to the other side of the wok. Add the chicken stock, both soy sauces, sugar, white pepper and sesame oil. Place the squash atop the vegetables. Place the spinach atop the squash. Cover the wok and let the juices boil for about 2 minutes.
  4. Using a slotted spoon, remove the noodles to a serving platter. Stir the vegetables and juice together and bring to a boil, stirring. Remove from the heat, and season to taste. Pour the sauce and vegetables over the noodles and serve immediately.

####  Tip

  * Shanghai-style noodles, extra-thick and spaghetti-shaped, are available fresh in most Asian groceries. Lo mein noodles and dried linguine are good substitutes.
