# Shanghai Noodles

Published: Nov 2, 2016 Â· Modified: Apr 6, 2022 by Chuck Underwood Â· 4 Comments

Jump to Recipe

If you love noodles, you'll love this recipe. Thick, chewy Udon Noodles,
Shiitake Mushrooms, and baby Bok Choy soaking in a sweet & savory Stir Fry
Sauce. People may not get Shanghaied in Portland anymore, but you'll be sure
to sneak these **Shanghai Noodles** away because everyone's going to want
some!

The idea for this recipes comes from Portland's not too distant, shady past
and the fact that our famous tunnels are said to be haunted. You see....
Portland was known as "The Shanghai Capital of the World", and the tunnels
that still exist underneath old town get bombarded every Halloween for tours.

> If you arenâ€™t familiar with _shanghaiing,_ it refers to the capture and
> illegal sale of able-bodied men to sea captains in need of crewmen.
> Unscrupulous (to say the least) middlemen kidnapped men and sold them off to
> captains for as little as $50 a head. These poor men were then forced to
> work on ships bound for the Orient with no pay. According to legend as well
> as some historical data, men were shanghaied in Portland from roughly 1850
> to 1941. Things were supposedly at their worst during Prohibition.  Link

Ahhh Portland....what a colorful city ðŸ™‚

So I was sitting here on Halloween, seeing ads for the haunted tunnel tours,
and thinking about noodles..... _Udon Noodles to be exact_.... and so I
googled Shanghai Noodles. Imagine my surprise when I found out they were a
real thing....and boy did they sound good!

The rest, as they say, is history.

I hope you enjoy my version of Shanghai Noodles and if so - please leave a
comment. And if you're ever walking around Old Town Portland.....well - let's
just say watch out for those hidden trap doors..... ðŸ˜‰



## Shanghai Noodles



Shanghai Noodles | Brand New Vegan

You'll need some Udon Noodles, Shiitake Mushrooms, Napa Cabbage, Baby Bok
Choy, Garlic, Ginger, Green Onions, and a Carrot for this recipe. For the
sauce, I mixed Soy Sauce, Hoisin Sauce, Mirin, a little Chili Garlic Paste and
just a little Brown Sugar.

A very simple Stir Fry..... you got this!

The Udon Noodles I bought were precooked and compacted in a little 7oz package
with a seasoning packet (throw that away). I simply added 3 of those packages
of noodles to some hot water and let them slowly unwind from each other. Stir
them around with a wooden spoon if it helps. Then drain and set aside.

Make the sauce by whisking all the sauce ingredients over low heat, and when
it starts to simmer, add a slurry of 1 Tbs cornstarch and 1 Tbs water. to
thicken. Remove from heat when thickened and set aside.

Stir Fry the ginger and garlic in a little water until softened, then add 1
shredded carrot, a small bundle of chopped Baby Bok Choy, an 8 oz package of
Shiitake Mushrooms and about Â¼ head of chopped Napa Cabbage.

When the veggies are nice and soft stir in the sauce and the noodles. Mix well
to combine and serve with chopped Green Onions for garnish.

As always - leave those comments! I love getting your comments and I read each
and every one! Once again, thank all of you for supporting Brand New Vegan!!!

Enjoy!

Every time I come to your page, I end up in the kitchen. Plan on making this
soon but today I have to spend outdoors in a garden.  
I've made it before and have to do it again.

Can you show the package of noodles? Seems like there are several kinds and I
never get the right ones

You'll find the precooked Udon noodles in the refrigerated Asian foods section
(some stores also sell them on the shelf with the other asian noodles.) There
could be different brands in different areas of the country.

Chuck, I have been trying to cut out flour products and I just was thinking
that this would be awesome made with nuPasta (konjac) noodles. Maybe you could
try it one day soon?
