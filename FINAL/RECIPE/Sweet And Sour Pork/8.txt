#  Sweet and Sour Pork

Getting reviews...

While this quick recipe deviates from the American Chinese restaurant classic
that inspired it‚Äîpineapple and bell pepper are replaced by carrots and snow
peas and the pork is stir-fried rather than deep fried‚Äîthe ketchup is not a
shortcut. In fact, it helps give this dish its signature tanginess.

##  Ingredients

Deselect All

1 pound pork tenderloin, cut into 1/2-inch pieces

2 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Kosher salt

2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce

1 tablespoon cornstarch

3 tablespoons ketchup

3 tablespoons sugar, plus a pinch

3 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil

3 cloves garlic, minced

2 carrots, thinly sliced

3 scallions, cut into 1/2-inch pieces

3 cups snow peas, cut in half

##  Directions

  1. Toss the pork with 1/2 tablespoon vinegar and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Mix the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar, the soy sauce, cornstarch, ketchup, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1/3 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon salt in another bowl. 
  2. Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add the pork and slowly stir until it turns mostly opaque, about 2 minutes. Remove the pork with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate. Discard the oil and wipe out the skillet. 
  3. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon peanut oil in the skillet, then stir-fry the garlic with a pinch each of salt and sugar, 15 seconds. Add the carrots and scallions and stir-fry until crisp-tender, 2 minutes. (Add a little water if the garlic starts to stick to the skillet.) Add the pork, snow peas and soy sauce mixture; stir until the pork is cooked through and the sauce is thickened, about 3 minutes.
