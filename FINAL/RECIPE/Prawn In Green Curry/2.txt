# Green Prawn Curry (step by step)

June 2, 2020 by maria 5 Comments

**Easy Green Prawns Curry recipe made with step-wise instructions.** The curry
has a blend of fresh coconut, herbs, spices and with veggies like drumstick
and potatoes. However adding veggies are optional. The green curry mainly
comes from coriander leaves and chilies.

This curry goes well with pav, appams, sanas (idlis), steamed rice or dosas.
We had ours with steamed rice and also rava fish fry along. **Recipe courtesy
and credit goes to my mother for a sumptuous meal and delicious curry ðŸ™‚ who
would not love their mother 's food??**

We made this curry with prawns you could make with any fish. Also the
ingredients used for the curry should be easily located in your kitchen. The
consistency should be of medium consistency but if you like it thinner then
add more water accordingly. Also if you love spice then add more green
chilies.

To add some tang in the curry we have added tamarind. But if tamarind isn't
available then use 1 slice of raw mango or 1 raw mango seed or kokams. So use
any of them as per your convenience.

1\. Marinate prawns with lime juice, salt and turmeric powder. Place aside for
