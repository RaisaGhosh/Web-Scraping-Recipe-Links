## Crispy Chilli Corn

Crispy Chilli Corn is an Indo-Chinese recipe of delicious corn kernels deep-
fried and sautéed in a delicious Indo-Chinese flavoured sauce.

This is one of those simple yet delicious recipes which can be prepared
quickly. The corn kernels are coated with a layer of cornflour and fried until
they turn golden and crispy. These crispy corns are then sautéed with onion,
garlic and Chinese sauces which adds an extra sizzle to the normal corn.

My daughter loves this recipe especially during Monsoons (rainy season in
India) when the corn is in abundance. I love using seasonal vegetables and
fruits in my cooking and hence during Monsoon I cook lots of dishes using
sweetcorn. Everyone in my family enjoys sweetcorn and have a long list of
favourites like Crispy Masala Corn, Sweetcorn Dhokla, Crispy Corn Nibbles,
Vegetable Sweetcorn Soup, Pocket Cheese Corn Toastie amongst many others.

This crunchy and crispy vegetarian appetizer is an interesting, colourful and
flavourful recipe with all the flavours of sweet, salty and spicy.

## Ingredients

**For Boiling**  
2 cups corn kernels  
Salt to taste

**For Coating**  
½ cup plain flour  
½ cup corn flour  
1 teaspoon black pepper  
1 teaspoon garlic powder  
Salt to taste

**For The Sauce**  
2 teaspoons sesame oil  
1 teaspoon finely chopped green chillies  
2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic  
1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger  
1 teaspoon finely chopped celery  
½ cup chopped onion  
½ cup chopped green pepper  
2 teaspoons soy sauce  
2 teaspoons vinegar  
2 teaspoons schezwan sauce  
2 teaspoons red chilli sauce  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon black pepper  
2 tablespoons corn flour  
2 tablespoons spring onions

**Other Ingredients**  
Oil for deep frying

## Directions

Step-1

Heat 2-3 cups water in a pan and add the salt and corn kernels. Boil them for
about 3-4 minutes.

After 3-4 minutes, strain the corn using a colander and keep it aside to let
it cool.

Step-2

Add 2 tablespoons plain flour, cornflour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder
and 1 tablespoon water to the boiled corn kernels and mix gently to lightly
coat the corn.

Step-3

Repeat the same process of adding 2 tablespoons plain flour, corn flour and
water to coat the corn kernels evenly with the mixture. It takes 2-3 repeats
to coat the corn evenly.

Sieve the battered corn kernels using a strainer to remove the extra flour
from the corn kernels.

Step-4

Heat oil in a pan for frying. To check if the oil is hot enough to start
frying, add a corn kernel to the oil and if it sizzles up immediately then you
know the oil is ready for frying.

Using a strainer, gently slide the coated corn kernels in the oil on high
heat. I prefer to partially cover (60-80%) the pan with a lid as the corn
tends to splutter a lot of oil. Fry them on high heat for 2-3 minutes until
they turn crispy and golden brown.

Use a strainer to remove them from the oil. Drain them on a kitchen
roll/absorbent paper to soak excess oil.

Step-5

Heat oil in a pan and sauté the green chili, ginger, garlic and celery for a
minute.

Next add the onions and green pepper and sauté for a couple of minutes.

Step-6

Add the salt, black pepper, schezwan sauce, red chilli sauce, soy sauce,
vinegar, and mix on high heat.

Mix corn flour in 2 tablespoons of water and mix it to form smooth corn flour
slurry.

Step-7

Add the corn flour slurry and cook it for 1 minutes.

Next add the fried corn and spring onions and gently mix to coat the corn
evenly with the sauce.

Serve hot garnished with spring onions.

## Tips & Variations

  1. Fresh and frozen both corn works for this recipe. Fresh corn kernels need to be boiled and cooled down before adding the flour. Frozen corn kernels can be defrosted and used.
  2. While coating corn kernels, sprinkle 1-2 tablespoons plain flour and corn flour in batches. Sprinkle little water and again repeat the same process 3-4 times until the corn kernels are coated well.
  3. Coating the corn kernels evenly results in a crispy corn.
  4. It’s important to fry the corn kernels on high heat.
  5. The only tricky part of the recipe is the frying part. After adding corn kernels to the hot oil, cover the frying pan (60-80%) with a lid as there is moisture in the corn and they expand while frying and because of these the corn kernels can at times burst.
  6. It's better to serve the corn kernels immediately otherwise they may turn soggy.
  7. Sesame oil when added, gives a nutty flavour to this dish. It enhances the flavour and gives aroma to the gravy. However, if you want, you can add any vegetable oil.
  8. I have added corn flour slurry to the gravy to make it thick. If it is not thickened, then add more corn flour slurry to the gravy.
  9. Adjust the amount of red chili sauce and green chilli sauce according to your taste.
