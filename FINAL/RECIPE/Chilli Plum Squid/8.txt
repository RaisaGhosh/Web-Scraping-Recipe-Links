### Ingredients

Salt and pepper squid

  * 800 gram fresh squid tubes, with tentacles, cleaned
  * 1/4 cup (35g) cornflour
  * oil to deep-fry, plus 1 tbsp extra
  * 1/2 fresh small red chilli, seeded, finely chopped
  * 1/2 red capsicum, finely diced
  * 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
  * 1 tablespoon sea salt
  * 2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  * 1/2 teaspoon five spice powder
  * coriander leaves, to serve

### Method

Salt and pepper squid

  * 1

Cut squid tubes down the length of one side and open out flat. Using a sharp
knife, score shallow diagonal slashes on inside surface of tubes and cut into
5cm pieces. Pat dry scored pieces and tentacles with paper towel. Dust with
cornflour, shaking off excess. Set aside.

  * 2

Heat oil to 180°C. Deep-fry squid for 2-3 minutes, in batches, until light
golden. Drain on paper towel and keep warm. Meanwhile, combine salt, pepper
and five spice in small bowl.

  * 3

Heat extra oil in a large wok on high. Add chilli, capsicum and garlic and
stir-fry 20 seconds. Add cooked squid and toss for 1 minute. Sprinkle with
five spice mixture and toss for another minute. Serve scattered with coriander
leaves.

### Notes

If you're using whole squid, pull head with tentacles from the main body and
remove intestines from the inside tube. Cut away tentacles in one piece.
Discard the head and intestines. Pull out the transparent quill and discard.
Remove skin and rinse the squid well under cold running water.
