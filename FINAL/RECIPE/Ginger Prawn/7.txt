###  Ginger Prawns Indian Style

Among the seafood delicacies, Prawns are exotic tasty and nutritious. Easy to
cook and of late due to prawn farming, cost effective as well. Prawns can be
adapted in various recipes. I've found this recipe not only popular but it
leaves a memory of fine dining that lingers on and on.....  

  

**Ingredients:**  
Shelled de-veined jumbo prawns - 500gms marinated with salt pepper and vinegar
for 2-4 hours in the fridge  
Brown onion paste - 2 Tbsp(Sliced onions shallow fried with little oil till
brown and ground to a fine paste in the mixer blender.)  
Ginger paste - 1 Tbsp  
Garlic paste - 1 Tsp  
Kashmiri chilly powder - 1 Tbsp  
Turmeric powder - 1/2 Tsp  
Tomato puree - 2 Tbsp  
Jeera powder - 1/2 Tsp  
Dhania powder - 1/2 Tsp  
Kasoori methi - a pinch  
Salt - to taste  
Sugar - 1 Tsp  
Refined oil - 25 Ml  
Coriander leaves - to garnish  
Lemon wedges(Optional)  
  
  
---  
**Ginger Prawns and Mushroom Pulav**  
  
**Method:**  
Shallow fry the prawns in little oil with little turmeric powder and Kashmiri
chilly powder till slightly cooked. Remove and keep aside.  
Heat remaining oil, fry the brown onion paste, ginger garlic paste, salt, all
the powders and kasoori methi till oil leaves the sides.  
Add sugar and tomato puree and fry till raw smell disappears.  
Add the prawns, mix well and fry for 2 mins with masala, cover, simmer for 2
mins or till prawns are cooked and the gravy is thick.  
Serve garnished with chopped coriander leaves and lemon wedges.  
  
Goes well with steamed plain Basmati Rice, Rotis, parathas or ghee rice.
