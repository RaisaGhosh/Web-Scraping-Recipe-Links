If you love seafood, you'll really love these delicious honey ginger prawns.
They'll go down a treat with the entire family.

## Ingredients

  * 2 tsp sesame oil
  * 1kg peeled green prawns (tail on), deveined, butterflied*
  * 1 tbsp grated ginger
  * 1 large garlic clove, minced
  * 1 tbsp soy sauce
  * juice of 1 lemon
  * 1/2 cup (125ml) water
  * 1 1/2 tbsp honey

## Method

  * 1

Mix sesame oil, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, lemon, water and honey in a bowl,
until combined.

  * 2

Place prawns into the bowl and coat with the mixture. Leave to marinade for 10
minutes in the fridge.

  * 3

Heat a wok or a large pan. Add the prawns and stir well.

  * 4

Stir-fry until the prawns are pink and cooked through (about 4–5 minutes).

## Notes

  * If you have a side burner on your barbecue, cooking these prawns in a wok is ideal as the smell won't be contained in your kitchen.
  * You can cook the prawns as they are but I like to butterfly mine by holding the prawn at the tail and cutting along the back of the prawn but not all the way through. When you do this, the prawns curl during the cooking process which makes them look pretty.
  * Sometimes I split the ingredients and cook in 2 batches to stop the prawns from stewing. It will all depend on how big your wok is and how hot you can get it.
  * If you like your prawns really sweet you may want to add more honey, but I like just a touch so as not to overpower all that lovely prawn flavour.
