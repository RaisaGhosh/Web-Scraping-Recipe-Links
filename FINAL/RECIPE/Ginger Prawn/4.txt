**Garlic, ginger, and chilli work wonderfully together to make this delicious
prawn dish.**

These garlic, ginger, and chilli prawns use all fresh ingredients instead of
dried, which packs them with plenty of flavour. We've used raw king prawns but
you easily use ready-cooked prawns. At just 217 calories and 6.1g of fat per
serving this garlic, ginger, and chilli prawns is a great option if you're
counting calories or opting for low calorie meals (opens in new tab).

## Ingredients

  * 2 tsp rapeseed oil or sesame oil
  * 1 large clove garlic, peeled and chopped
  * ½-1 green chilli, deseeded and finely sliced
  * 1 tsp grated fresh ginger
  * 400g (14oz) raw king prawns
  * 100g (3½oz) sugar-snap peas (see tip, right)

To serve:

  * Brown rice
  * Lime wedges
  * Coriander, to garnish, optional

  3. Serve with rice, drizzled with the oil from the pan, and lime wedges. Garnish with coriander, if you like.

## Top tips for making garlic, ginger and chilli prawns
