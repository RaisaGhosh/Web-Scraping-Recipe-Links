## **‚ù§Ô∏è** About This Recipe

**2 Methods:** Originally I have shared a stovetop pressure cooker recipe in
2012. I have mentioned that method below. Now I have updated this post to add
instant pot coriander rice recipe method.

**Quick to make:** The prep work takes around 20 minutes and cook time will be
15 minutes. So this coriander rice recipe will **come together in just 35
minutes**.

**Healthy & Nutritious:** Here coriander leaves paste is added while cooking.
Plus, lots of veggies like peas, carrots, cauliflower, etc are added to make
it more healthy.

**Taste:** This is mild in taste meaning no spice powders are added. Still, it
is so flavorful. You can make it spicy by increasing the amount of green
chilies.

**Great for Lunchbox:** This Indian cilantro rice or pulao can be packed into
kids‚Äô or adults‚Äô lunchboxes with yogurt or raita in a separate container.

## üßæIngredient Notes

Here is the pic of the ingredients used in making this flavorful coriander
rice. The detailed amount is mentioned in the recipe card below.

  * **Rice:** I mostly use the basmati rice recipe. So the water amount and cooking time mentioned here are for basmati rice only. If you are using other verities of rice then adjust the water amount and cooking time accordingly.
  *  **Cilantro Or Coriander:** To make the paste, I have used leaves and stems both. Green chili: Here I have used serrano pepper. Adjust the amount of chili as per your liking spice level. 
  * **Veggies:** Onion is a must. You can play around with the rest veggies. Here I have used peas, carrot and cauliflower. You can add other veggies like beans, corn, potato, broccoli, etc.

## üë©‚Äçüç≥Step By Step Photo Instructions

**Prep:** Take basmati rice in a colander and wash under running cold water
until water runs clear. Or rinse them in a bowl 2-3 times or until water is
not cloudy anymore. Keep it aside as needed.

**Make Coriander Paste:**

1) Take coriander, ginger, garlic and green chili in a small grinder jar.

2) Add 2-3 tablespoons of water and grind it into a smooth paste.

**Make Instant Pot Coriander Rice Recipe:**

3) Turn on the instant pot with saute mode and add oil. Once hot, add whole
spices (cloves, green cardamom and bay leaf). Saute for 30-40 seconds or until
you get a nice aroma of the spices.

4) Add sliced onions and cook for 2-3 minutes or until they start to get soft
and translucent.

5) Add veggies (carrot, peas, cauliflower) and salt.

6) Add prepared paste and mix. If it is sticking to the bottom then turn off
the saute mode.

7) Add rice and water.

8) Stir well to combine. Scrape the bottom of the instant pot liner if
anything is stuck otherwise you‚Äôll get burn notice.

9) Cover with a lid, keep the valve to sealing. Cook on **manual (high
pressure) for 4 minutes.** Then do **QPR** (quick pressure release) by
positioning the valve to venting manually. Once the pin drops, open the
lid.Let it rest for 5-10 minutes in the liner itself without disturbing.

10) Then fluff it up and mix gently using a fork or spatula.

**Stovetop Pressure Cooker Method:**

1) Follow the same steps as above until step-7.  
2) Here you‚Äôll need a little more water than you‚Äôll need for instant pot. See
the amount mentioned in the recipe card below.  
3) Cover the cooker with a lid, put the whistle on and cook on high heat for 2
whistles.  
4) Let the pressure go down by itself and then open the lid.

## **üí≠** Expert Tips

  * **10 minutes of resting time after opening the lid is a must.** During this resting time, rice grain will firm up. So they don‚Äôt get break or mushy while fluffing up or mixing.
  *  **Variations:**
    *  _Try adding a handful of mint leaves_ along with coriander while making a paste. It adds a nice refreshing flavor.
    *  _Skip adding veggies_ and keep it plain.
    *  _Add your choice of other veggies_ like broccoli, green beans, sweet corn, baby corn, eggplant, zucchini, cabbage, broccoli, bell pepper, etc.

## üçΩ Serving Ideas

Serve this Indian coriander rice with any raita or plain yogurt or pickle.
Also, have some roasted or fried papadum on the side to complete the meal. As
this is mild rice, I prefer to serve with spicy, intense flavored raita like
tadka raita, onion tomato raita.

Tried it last night - really yummy. For veggies I only added potatoes and peas
- no cauliflower and was super good. I did put 1/2 tsp of red chili powder for
an extra kick and that was rewarding!
