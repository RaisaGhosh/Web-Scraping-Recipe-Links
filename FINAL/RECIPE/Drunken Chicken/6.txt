Drunken chicken is one of the most-loved chicken dishes to have on a hot
summer 's day. The dish is cold, luscious, and drenched in wine.

Drunken chicken is extremely simple to make. You simmer it, you slice it up,
and you dunk it in the soup in which it cooked, in addition to an equal
measure of the wine.

The chicken can stay immersed for a long time and just turn out to have some
extra taste of alcohol as the days pass by (which is a good thing!).

While you can add a lot of fixings to drunken chicken, you would not want to
go for it because the taste of the wine goes down.

Hereâ€™s how you can make drunken chicken!

 **Health Benefits**

Each serving of drunken chicken has 354 calories, 5 g saturated fat, and 110

#### How to Make Drunken Chicken

  1. Cut a 12 inches long piece of aluminum foil paper. Fold up in half and put on the grill, moving edges under the grill to tuck them in.
  2. Get rid of excess fat or skin clinging to the chicken and bathe with cool water. Dry thoroughly using paper towels. Flavor the chicken's interior and exterior surfaces generously with Cajun seasoning. Ascertain that the seasoning gets under the skin of the breast.
  3. Open up the can of beer, take a large blob out (equaling 1 ounce of the liquid) and either drink or discard it.
  4. Add up liquid crab boil to the beer. Take apart the skin from the neck area by approaching your finger between the skin and meat. Hold the pocket open and dispense beer into the pocket. Repeat the same in several areas; a large injection needle will make it easier for you to do so.
  5. Slide the chicken breast over the can of beer, holding on to the beer can and chicken while softly putting on the foil-covered zone of the grill.
  6. Close the grill and saute for 45-60 minutes at 165 degrees F or 74 degrees C, until you see the juices running clear and the chicken is cooked.
  7. When it is cooked, carefully transfer the chicken onto a large cutting board. Take away the beer can and loosely cover with aluminum foil.
  8. Let stay for 8-10 minutes before you serve.

 **Trivia**

There are numerous varieties of drunken chicken in Latin America, China, and
Greece. The Argentine, Chilean, and Mexican renditions of this dish are called
'pollo borracho' and take in green and black olives and cinnamon.
