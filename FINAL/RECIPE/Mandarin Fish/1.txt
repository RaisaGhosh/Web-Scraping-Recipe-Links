###  Ingredients

  * **1** large piece of sea perch or barramundi
  * **1 tbsp** potato flour
  * **pinch** of salt
  * **1 tsp** sugar
  * **1 tbsp** Chinese cooking wine
  * **1** beaten egg
  * **1** pork cawl (intestine lining, from Chinese butchers)
  * oil, for deep-frying fish

**Sauce**

  * **2 tbsp** Chinese cooking wine
  * **2 tbsp** soy sauce
  * **2 tsp** sesame oil
  * salt (optional)

**Garnish**

  * a little oil, for frying
  * shallots, finely sliced in 4 cm lengths
  * **few** Szechuan peppercorns
  * **2 cm piece** ginger, finely sliced
  * **1 small** handful of coriander leaves

### Cook's notes

Oven temperatures are for conventional; if using fan-forced (convection),
reduce the temperature by 20ËšC. | We use Australian tablespoons and cups: 1
teaspoon equals 5 ml; 1 tablespoon equals 20 ml; 1 cup equals 250 ml. | All
herbs are fresh (unless specified) and cups are lightly packed. | All
vegetables are medium size and peeled, unless specified. | All eggs are 55-60
g, unless specified.

### Instructions

Sprinkle fish with Chinese wine, sugar, salt and potato flour. Cover with
beaten egg. Fold and wrap pork cawl around fish, sealing with the egg.

Heat oil in wok till very hot, place fish in oil carefully and monitor
browning process using tongs or chopsticks to turn the fish when brown on one
side. When well browned and cooked place into strainer and drain well. Place
on serving plate. (Could place on draining paper while preparing sauce.)

Brown finely chopped slivers of shallots in oil flavoured with peppercorns.
Scatter ginger, coriander and a little fresh shallot.

Serve with rice and steamed or stir fried Chinese vegetables.
