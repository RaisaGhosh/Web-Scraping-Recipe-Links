###  Wok-tossed King Prawns in Soy Sauce

  

  

I love fresh large king/tiger prawns and they are already so delicious on
their own that you don't have to do much to it to prepare a tasty dish.﻿ Here,
I have just cooked them in a soy base, which reminds me of how my mum used to
make them when I was little. When I served it to Zach for dinner, he was a
little upset and didn't want to eat it because he wanted the "crispy one" that
I usually deep-fry in batter. Well, we told him that if he didn't eat them, he
wouldn't be having any chocolate chip cookies for dessert. So he reluctantly
ate a few mouthfuls, with a little scowl on his face just to insist that he
wasn't going to like it. But after a while, I think he started to enjoy eating
it because he was trying hard to restrain from smiling everytime he had a
spoonful of the soy-coated prawn with his rice. It must be the sweet and salty
black sauce. Kids just love anything in soy (and we adults do too). And it's
easy and delicious!

  

**Wok-tossed King Prawns in Soy Sauce**

  

**Ingredients**

  

500g large prawns, kept whole, washed, feelers trimmed off and deveined

3 cloves garlic

5 slices ginger

3-5 bird's eye chilli (optional)

A handful of coriander, chopped

  

Sauce (combine in a bowl):

1 1/2 tbsp light soy sauce

2 tbsp dark soy sauce

1/2 tsp sugar

1 1/2 tbsp chinese cooking wine

3-4 drops sesame oil

1/4 cup water

Pinch of salt

1/2 tsp black pepper

Dash of white pepper

  

**Method**

  

  1. Heat up some oil in a wok on high heat. Drain the prawns of any liquid and toss the prawns in to fry for about a minute until almost cooked. Be sure not to overcrowd the wok, or else the prawns will start to stew. Remove and set aside.

  2. Heat up 1 tbsp of oil in wok, fry garlic and ginger till fragrant. Add in chilli if used. Pour in sauce ingredients and bring to a boil until it is slightly reduced. Check for seasoning.

  3. Toss in the prawns and fry quickly on high heat until coated in sauce and just cooked. Turn off heat and stir in chopped coriander. Dish out and serve with steamed jasmine rice.
