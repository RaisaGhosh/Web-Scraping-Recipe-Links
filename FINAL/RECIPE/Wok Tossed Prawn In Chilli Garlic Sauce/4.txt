# prawns with garlic, chilli, ginger and coriander: tossed through a wok

June 22, 2010 4 Comments

These prawns with garlic, chilli, ginger and coriander then tossed through a
wok are so easy and delicious.

De vein and de-shell some prawns leaving the heads and tails on, enough for
two portions.

You will need the following ingredients:

Plus some teriyaki or soya sauce.

Crush 2 cloves of garlic, finely grate the ginger (about a tablespoon), chop
up a good handful of coriander and de-seed and finely chop up 2 red chillies.

Heat about a tablespoon or 2 of peanut oil and a dash of sesame oil in a wok
until it's smoking.  Add the garlic and chilli and briefly cook (a few
seconds).  Add the prawns and all the other ingredients and stir fry until
nice and pink and curled up.  Squeeze over the juice of a lime and add a
generous splash of teriyaki or soya sauce.

Thanks Nina, I find prawns to be one of the most 'photogenic' foods, they
pretty much always look beautiful

  3. Marisa 12 years ago
