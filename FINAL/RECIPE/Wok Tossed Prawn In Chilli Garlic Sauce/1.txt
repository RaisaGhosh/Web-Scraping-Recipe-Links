School prawns are small but sweet. Luke leaves the shells on for this
Vietnamese stir-fry recipe - the prawns are young, and the shells are tender
and crisp. The tail also adds great texture.

###  Ingredients

  * **300 g** small tiger prawns, heads and legs trimmed
  * **2 tbsp** vegetable oil
  * **1 tbsp** finely diced garlic
  * **1 tbsp** finely diced red Asian shallots
  * **½ tsp** black pepper
  * **1 tsp** shrimp paste, mixed with 1 tbsp water

**Marinade**

  * **1 tbsp** sugar
  * **2 tbsp** fish sauce
  * **1 tsp** chilli powder

### Cook's notes

Oven temperatures are for conventional; if using fan-forced (convection),
reduce the temperature by 20˚C. | We use Australian tablespoons and cups: 1
teaspoon equals 5 ml; 1 tablespoon equals 20 ml; 1 cup equals 250 ml. | All
herbs are fresh (unless specified) and cups are lightly packed. | All
vegetables are medium size and peeled, unless specified. | All eggs are 55-60
g, unless specified.

### Instructions

**Marinating time:** 20 minutes

In a mixing bowl, combine marinade ingredients. Add the prawns and marinate
for 20 minutes.

Heat the oil in a hot wok. Add the prawns and stir-fry until prawns begin to
change colour.

Add garlic, red shallots, pepper, shrimp paste, chilli and spring onions, and
stir-fry for a further minute.

Garnish with coriander and chilli. Serve with cucumber.
