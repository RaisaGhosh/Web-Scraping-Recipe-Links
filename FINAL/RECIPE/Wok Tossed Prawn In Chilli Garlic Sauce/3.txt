# Recipe: Lebanese chilli garlic prawns

IndiatimesUpdated on Jan 09, 2012, 21:45 IST

Juicy, succulent prawns are a delicacy from the word go. They taste heavenly
when served straight off a live grill or Teppanyaki.  
Curiously, most of us that relish prawns and order prawn-based dishes at the
drop of a hat in restaurants, are not exactly confident about cooking the
seafood at home, far less experimenting with it. It is, however, a little-
known fact that prawns call for a no-fuss cooking, and not to mention, are
easily available in the local market or departmental store. Fresh ingredients,
fresh prawns and the right recipe are all you need, and you are good to go.  

  
Chef Ashish Rai of Barbeque Nation, Delhi, simplifies the dilemma of cooking
prawns at home by sharing with us three simple but experimental recipes that
can be rustled up on a lazy weekend.  
Why not have your friends over when you don the chef's hat.
