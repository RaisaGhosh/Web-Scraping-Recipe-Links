#  Chowman (Tollygunge)  
  
---  
Chowman Interiors  
  
This **Chinese** & **Thai restaurant** , **Chowman** , located in
**Tollygunge** area (walking distance from both **South City Mall & Golf
Club**), at **Prince Golam Mohammad Shah Road** to be exact is quite
outstanding and overtly popular in South Kolkata. Most people avail the **Home
Delivery** & Take Away facility though because of its small space consisting
of only 4 tables and one could just eavesdrop into the conversation of the
nearby table very easily. In spite of the tininess of the place, they have
made it quite cozy. The wall décor has abstract Chinese paintings & wall
hangings. They play soft, delightful Chinese instrumentals in the background
which makes anyone feel that they have been virtually transferred to a small
town in China. The Red & Black cushioned chairs have an uncanny resemblance to
Haka restaurant outlets. The tables are all laid out well always with proper
matching red hand napkins, Chinese style bamboo table mats, chopsticks,
Chinese tea pots (Aladdin Genie Lamp) containing sauces apart from the regular
Salt and pepper shakers.

Pan Fried Fish  
The heavy booklet menu is quite elaborate and can easily explain to anyone the
contents of any dish. For starters we had ordered **Pan Fried Fish**. It was
real spicy and properly pan fried with different types of sauces and
vegetables. Fish was moist and properly coated with batter. Overall it was a
first-class dish. **Lemon Coriander Thick Mixed Soup** was light, flavorful
with a perfect blend of salt & pepper. It's so refreshing that it somehow
soothes you from inside.  
  
  
  
---  
Thai Style Fried Rice  
  
And for main course we went for the **Thai Style Fried Rice** and **Chilli
Garlic Chicken with Red Peppers**. Fried rice was authentic Thai fried rice
which u get know it from the smell of kaffir lime leaves when they serve it.
You will get big chunks of chicken in it with different types of vegetable
like broccoli, tomato, bell peppers and some basil leaves. It has all the
ingredients like one proper Thai dish should have. The quantity is well enough
to serve handsomely to two people. As of for the chilli garlic chicken it was
mild hot in taste not too much spicy, though I didn't get the flavour of the
garlic much. It got big pieces of red and green bell peppers. Still it tasted
good with the fried rice. Some of the must try dishes are **Stir Fried Chicken
with Basil, Roasted Chilly Pork** , **Moon Fan Fried Rice** , **Thai Style
Noodles** , **Shredded Lamb in Chili Garlic Sauce**. The prices are worth the
quality of the food. The **average cost for two persons is approximately Rs.
700** inclusive of taxes.  
  
---  
Chilli Garlic Chicken with Red Peppers  
  
The restaurant can remain popular among foodies if only they can maintain the
standard of food & service they provide, because at times the quality degrades
during peak hours. The staffs are well mannered and help the clientele in
making good suggestions of food items. One unique thing about them is that
they give complimentary mouth freshener candies at the end of the meal and
also the small cute sauce bottles that they provide for home delivery orders.
One tip: If you are going to this place, try experimenting on new items,
rather than sticking to the same old regular Chinese Menu, because you won't
regret the outcome of it; and try visiting on a weekday to avoid the crowd &
waiting queues.
