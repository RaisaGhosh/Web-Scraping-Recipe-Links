### Why I Love This Recipe

Szechuan pepper is one of my favorite spices. It has a unique aroma and flavor
that is not like black or white pepper, or chili peppers, but has slight
citrusy overtone and creates kind of tingly numbness on the tongue. Many
recipes often suggest roasting and then crushing the tiny seedpods before
adding them to spice up dishes.

This Chinese Fried Squid dish is one of those dishes that I love to eat with
freshly roasted and crushed Szechuan peppercorns. The texture of the fried
squid with the tingly numbness of the tongue from the peppercorn dip is one
experience everyone must try at least once in their lifetime!

### Ingredients You'll Need

2 lb cleaned squid, cut into pieces  
2 tablespoons sea-salt  
3 tsp Szechuan peppercorn  
1 egg  
3/4 cup ice cold water  
1 cup all-purpose flour  
3 to 4 cups oil for deep-frying  
Cilantro leaves, for garnish  

* * *

### Directions

Preparation of Salt/Szechuan Peppercorn:

* * *

1\. In heavy pan, brown the salt and whole Szechuan peppercorns on medium to
medium-low heat. Stir fry the mixture until it’s fragrant and the salt turns a
light brown color(about 5 minutes).

* * *

2\. Remove and let it cool off.

* * *

3\. Use a mortar and pestle to grind the cooled mixture. Set aside for dipping
squid later.

* * *

Preparation of Squid:

* * *

4\. Stir the egg into the ice water. Add the flour and continue to stir to
form a thick, lumpy batter. Do not overmix (the batter should resemble a
pancake batter).

* * *

5\. Heat the oil to 350°F.

* * *

6\. Dip the squid into the flour/egg batter using your fingers to coat the
squid pieces.

* * *

7\. Add the squid and deep-fry until golden brown and crispy.

* * *

8\. Drain. Serve garnished with the coriander leaves, and with the salt and
pepper mix for dipping.
