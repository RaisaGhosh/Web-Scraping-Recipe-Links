# Chinese Sichuan Salt & Pepper Squid

Aug 11

Written By Lydia Jones

**Ingredients**

3-4 Large Local Squid Tubes, cleaned & cut into rings

2 tbls Shaoxing (Chinese Cooking) wine

½ tsp Sea Salt (for marinade)

1 tbls Ginger, finely grated

2 Cloves Garlic, finely grated

1 tsp Sesame Oil

½ tbls Sichuan Peppercorns

½ tbls Black Peppercorns

1 tsp Ground White Pepper

1 tbls Fine Sea Salt

1 teaspoon Chinese Five Spice

½ Cup Plain Flour

½ Cup Corn Flour

Peanut or Rice Bran Oil, for frying

**Method**

Place the squid in a bowl with the Shaoxing wine, salt, ginger, garlic and
sesame oil, marinate for 1 hour in the fridge.

While the squid is marinating, dry fry the Sichuan and black peppercorns in a
small pan over a medium heat until fragrant, set aside to cool. Grind
peppercorns in mortar and pestle or spice grinder until fine.

In a large bowl mix together the plain flour, corn flour, Sichuan & black
peppercorns, white pepper, sea salt and Chinese five spice, stir well.

Heat the peanut or rice bran oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat, until
it reaches 180℃ (test the temperature with a candy thermometer or
alternatively use a deep fryer)

Working in small batches drain the squid rings well, dredge in the flour
mixture shaking off the

excess, fry in the oil until golden and cooked through. Drain well on paper
towel.

Serve with lemon wedges and soy.
