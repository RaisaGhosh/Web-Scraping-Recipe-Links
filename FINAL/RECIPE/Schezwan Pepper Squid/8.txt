Skill: Medium  
Serves: 1-2

Ingredients

Szechuan pepper squid

  * 6 squid tubes
  * 3 tentacles
  * 1/2 tbsp szechuan pepper
  * 1 tbsp black pepper
  * 1 tbsp salt
  * Approximately 1/4 cup flour for dusting

Salad

  * 3-4 sweet peppers
  * 2-3 leaves of romain lettuce
  * 1/4 cup cucumber
  * 1/4 cup chopped onions
  * 1 seranno pepper
  * 1-2 tbsp of chopped coriander
  * Salt and pepper according to taste
  * Lime juice according to taste

Steps

Szechuan pepper squid

  * First we will prepare the spice misture to coat the squid. For this heat the szechuan pepper, black pepper and salt in a pan for a few minutes untill you smell the peppers. This helps bring out the flavours as well as makes it easier to grind as they lose moisture.
  * Using a rolling pin or a dry spice grinder roughly grind the mixture and keep it aside. We will need it shortly.
  * Cut the squid tubes into squares or rectangles. Don't worry about getting a perfect shape.
  * At this stage you can slightly score one side of the squid in a criss-cross fashion. It helps them curl while frying and the pattern looks great when fried.
  * Dry the squids with a paper towerl and lay them flat.
  * Sprinkle the pepper mixture and some flour on top of it and shake the excess off. Turn around and do the same for the other side.
  * Heat some oil in a beaker so that you have atleast 1 inch of oil to deep fry the squids.
  * Fry the squid few pieces at a time for about 30-45 seconds.
  * At this point you can have the squids as appetizers as well! Or keep reading to make a saladâ€¦

Salad

  * While the above squid preparation can compliment a salad with your choice of ingredients, this is the combination we used.
  * Chop all the ingredients mentioned user salad according to your liking.
  * Add salt, pepper and lime juice and mix well.
  * Serve the salad with the fried squid on top.
