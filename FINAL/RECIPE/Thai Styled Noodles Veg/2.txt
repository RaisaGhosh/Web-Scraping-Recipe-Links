All kinds of fun packed into one dish, the Thai Crispy Veg Noodle is one that
will instantly recharge your happiness quotient!  
  
A scrumptious base of crispy noodles is topped with delectable sautéed veggies
and a tongue-tickling sweet, sour and spicy sauce. A garnish of crushed
peanuts and spring onions adds to the taste, mouth-feel and aroma of the dish.  
  
You can prepare all the ingredients in advance, but just has to be assembled
just before serving as it tends to become soggy after a short while. Plus,
each serving needs to be assembled separately so that everyone gets an equal
share of all the goodies!  
  
You can also try other yummy Thai recipes like the Thai Smooothie or Thai
Sweet Corn Cutlets .
