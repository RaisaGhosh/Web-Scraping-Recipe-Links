# Spicy Chicken Wontons



The BEST spicy chicken wontons in a House Special Sauce

This is my take on a spicy chicken wonton swimming in a house special spicy
sausce.

I got inspiration for this dish from trying numerous wontons in different
ways. But, my favorite way is to have it swimming in sauce. When the sauce is
made right, it is not overpowering and pairs really well with the wontons to
extenuate the flavors.

If you ever had Din Tai Fung, these wontons give it a run for its money. It is
very easy to achieve and you can make it at home for a fraction of the price.

Dumplings are one of my favorite food items to eat because they are flavorful
and are very versatile in flavors.

Partially because they are fun to eat and the textures are exquisite.

For the wonton wrapper, I simply use store bought ones. I think they work
great when you are in a rush and have no time.

You can find the wonton wraps at your local Asian market or specialty store. I
like to make a bunch of these when and store them in the freezer whenever I
need a quick bite because they are always a quick, easy, and delicious meal to
make when you are on a budget and have little to no time to cook for yourself.

I really love using the freshest scallions, garlic, and ginger for this dish
because those aromatics help bring out all of the umami flavors.

For this dish, the House Special Sauce serves as a perfect pairing to make the
wontons taste even better. I will share a separate recipe on how to make the
sauce.

If you are looking for a quick and simple wonton dish, look no further because
this is it!

My PRO TIP** if you have any remaining wonton wrappers, fry them into chips
and you will have a bonus appetizer to serve alongside a sweet chili sauce.
