#### 4 Method Steps

  * Step 1

Combine chicken, shallots, garlic, ginger, lemon grass, lime leaves, water
chestnuts and fish sauce in a bowl.

  * Step 2

Place 10 wonton wrappers on a clean work surface. Spoon a heaped teaspoons of
chicken mixture onto centre of each wrapper. Brush edges with water. Pinch
together to enclose filling. Repeat with remaining wrappers and chicken
mixture. (To freeze, see below.)

  * Step 3

Add oil to a deep frying pan to reach a depth of 4cm. To test when oil is
ready, a cube of bread should turn golden brown in 15 seconds. Deep-fry 10
wontons at a time for 5-6 mins or until golden. Drain on paper towel. Repeat
with remaining wontons.

  * Step 4

Serve with sweet chilli sauce.
