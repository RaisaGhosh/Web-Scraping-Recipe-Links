**Rice vermicelli** is a thin form of noodle.[1] It is sometimes referred to
as 'rice noodles' or 'rice sticks', but should not be confused with cellophane
noodles, a different Asian type of vermicelli made from mung bean starch or
rice starch rather than rice grains themselves.

## Presentation and varieties[edit]

Rice vermicelli is a part of several Asian cuisines, where it are often eaten
as part of a soup dish, stir-fry, or salad. One particularly well-known,
slightly thicker variety, called _Guilin mǐfěn_ (桂林米粉), comes from the
southern Chinese city of Guilin, where it is a breakfast staple.

## Names[edit]

Rice vermicelli is widely known in Asia by cognates of Hokkien 米粉 ( _bí-hún_ ,
literally "rice vermicelli"). These include _bīfun_ (Japan), _bíjon_ or
_bihon_ (Philippines), _bee hoon_ (Singapore), _bihun_ or _mee hoon_ (Malaysia
and Indonesia), _num banh chok_ (Cambodia), _bún_ (Vietnam), and _mee hoon_
(Southern Thailand).

### Naming in Taiwan[edit]

Beginning July 1, 2014, Food and Drug Administration of Taiwan rules have been
in effect that only products made of 100% rice can be labeled and sold as "米粉"
in Taiwan, usually translated as "rice vermicelli" or "rice noodle". If the
product contains starch or other kinds of grain powder as ingredients but is
made of at least 50% rice, it is to be labeled as "調和米粉", meaning "blended
rice vermicelli".[2] Products made of less than 50% rice cannot be labelled as
rice vermicelli.[3]

## Notable dishes[edit]

### East Asia[edit]

#### Mainland China[edit]

Guilin rice noodles

  * Yunnan and Guangxi cuisine—famous dishes including Crossing-the-bridge noodles, Mixian, Guilin noodle and Luosifen (snail noodle). Rice noodle is also a main staple of ethnic Tai, Miao and Zhuang cuisine.
  * Cantonese noodles—a large number of Cantonese dishes use this ingredient (called 米粉 _maifun_ or "rice" in Cantonese). Usually the noodles are simmered in broth with other ingredients such as fish balls, beef balls or fish slices.
  * Fujian and Teochew cuisine, rice vermicelli is a commonly used noodle and is served either in soup, stir-fried and dressed with a sauce, or even "dry" (without soup) with added ingredients and condiments.

As the term 米粉 ( _mifen_ ) literally only means "rice noodles" in Chinese,
there is considerable variation among rice noodles granted this name. In Hubei
and historically in much of Hunan, _mifen_ refers to thick, flat rice noodles
made using a wet mix, similar to Shahe fen. In Changde, the term refer to
thick, round noodles that has supplanted the other _mifen_ in Hunan.[4] These
are _mifen_ in China, but not rice vermicelli noodles.
