Prawn Manchurian is a classic Manchurian seafood dish that is enjoyed all
around the world. It’s noted for its spicy qualities that pair well with
noodles and rice. You can make prawn Manchurian dry or covered in gravy. This
recipe directs you to prepare it dry by cooking the gravy till the moisture
evaporates, but that is an optional step. Just dry the gravy out till it is at
the consistency you prefer. Start cooking this today!

Prawn Manchurian taste great when they are served hot. Pack them in insulated
food containers or steel lunch box so you can eat it warm after a few hours.

 **Health Benefits**

Prawns have a lot of health benefits that make them a great addition to any
diet. Their high Omega-3 fatty acid content contributes to pulmonary health.
The fatty acids protect the heart from various diseases and improves blood
circulation which affects the heart’s overall effectiveness. Prawns are also
rich in selenium which is a cancer preventing compound. Selenium stops tumors
from developing and helps to inhibit cellular mutation by eliminating free
radicals in the body.
