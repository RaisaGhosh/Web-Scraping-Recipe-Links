Who doesn't like the exotic touch that Chinese condiments such as soy sauce
and vinegar add to prawns? This Chinese style Prawns Manchurian recipe will
delight those who enjoy spicy flavors.

This dish can be made dry or with gravy and it can go well with other Chinese
dishes like fried rice or noodles. You can even have the dry version as a
starter. Here we give a recipe for the dry version that serves 2 persons.

## Recipe for Prawns Manchurian

**Ingredients**

10 prawns (cleaned and peeled)  
1 Capsicum roughly chopped  
1 onion finely chopped  
2 green chillis, roughly chopped  
4 tablespoons of soy sauce.  
2 tablespoons of finely chopped garlic and ginger  
2 tablespoons cornflour  
2 tablespoons of all purpose flour (Maida)  
1 tablespoons of sugar  
2 tablespoons oil  
2 tablespoons Tomato Ketchup  
2 tablespoons Soy sauce  
1 tablespoon Green Chilli sauce  
1 teaspoon Vinegar  
Water as needed  
Salt to taste

**Procedure**

Mix tomato ketchup, soy sauce, green chilli sauce, vinegar. Make a smooth
paste of 1 tablespoon of cornflour with little water. Add this sauce mixture
and set aside.

Make a thick batter by adding Maida and cornflour to little water. Dip the
prawns in batter and fry till golden on a medium flame till they become crispy
and golden brown. Drain the fried prawns on a kitchen towel and set them
aside.

In the pan in which you have sauteed the prawns, add the onions, ginger,
garlic, green chillis, salt & sugar and saute them over medium-high heat, so
that they are lightly browned. Add the capsicum and and saute for about 3
minutes.

Add the sauce mixture, stir well so that the cornflour dissolves completely
and no lumps remain. Add in the fried prawns, toss well and cook till the
mixture dries up. You can tserve this dish by garnishing it finely cut fresh
spring onions on top.

**Note:** The above recipe is for dry Prawns Manchurian, but you can also make
the dish as a gravy, by just adding some water after adding the sauce and then
cook it till it becomes thick of desired consistency. You can then add the
fried prawns and enjoy the gravy.
