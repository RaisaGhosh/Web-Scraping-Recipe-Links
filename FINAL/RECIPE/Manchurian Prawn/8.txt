Prawn Manchurian Dry is a delicious Manchurian made with Prawns. This is a
dish direct from Amma's kitchen for all prawn lovers. This has thumbs up from
everybody at home and when the aroma was sneaking out, I knew everybody would
love it.

Boys are not that fond of Prawns and though the Prawns Roast is Chinnu's
favorite, and the Prawns Dum Biryani never fails to get their attention, they
are still reluctant to enjoy as they like chicken. Peddu stays away from
Prawns. So it's not a frequently bought season.

We decided to try another new dish even with the rarity this makes an
appearance. Amma's diary was taken out. She said she noted it down from a TV
show and ever since I said I have this challenge going on, she has been keen
on trying out all the recipes she has written down.

I just noticed that even with all its rare appearance, I do have a handful of
Prawn recipes.

Nice recipe. I like anything with prawns though I did not eat prawns / like
prawns until I was 18 or 19 years old.
