Delightful! This was such a flavorful recipe - raves from the boyfriend. I
didn't really end up deep frying the shrimp - I just sauteed it in the
cornstarch/ginger/etc mixture to reduce fat. Delicious!

I made this the other night and it was delicious!!! Full of flavor! I didn't
have the ginger or garlic paste so I used fresh and it was outstanding! I will
definatley make this again when I have friends over for dinner!

Yeah, this was YUMMY! I thought the cilantro would be too much, but it was
actually perfect. I even brought a bite over to my neighbor who loved it - as
did my two year old twins. Thanks!

Delicious. Make it easy on yourself and have all of your ingredients
chopped/measured so that the cooking process runs smoothly and quickly;
chopping in during the cooking could allow time for ingredients to burn and
turn bitter (especially garlic!) We put ours over rice noodles and it was
perfect!
