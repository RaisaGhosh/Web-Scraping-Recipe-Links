Prawn manchorian is an expensive dish that’s why I am conciuos to note the
recipe of it because every thing wrong spoil the taste of it.

Chicken Manchirian is easy to make all you need to do is to make it with full
attention because if you dont make it your chicken would get hard and the
taste of the manchurina would get worse.
