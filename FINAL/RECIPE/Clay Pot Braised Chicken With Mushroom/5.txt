RɛsɪpI

**Ready : 1 hr 10 mins** **[** Prep : 10 mins † Active : 20 mins † Excluding
Soaking Time **]**  
**Serves :** Pair with other dishes as in a Chinese dinner  
**Generic :** Braise  
**Difficulty :** Easy _ Printable Recipe _

-

**Braised Mushroom Chicken** is a very common household dish among the
Chinese, simply because it is easy to cook and absolutely flavorful and
delicious. This is a typical dish from Northern China which is famous for
their culinary skills in braising or stewing. The braised dish has a
concentrated savory flavor with the dried Shiitake Mushroom providing an
earthy umami touch. The braising process allows the Chicken and Mushrooms to
slowly cook to tenderness perfection while absorbing the rich flavorful
delicious sauce, thus ideally making it an excellent dish to go with plain
white rice. However, the dish presented here has an additional somewhat
luxurious Ingredients - **Fish Maw** - which makes the preparation of the dish
just a little more complicated as extra time is needed to prepare the Fish Maw
in the correct way. The unique Fish Maw's texture adds a totally new dimension
to the dish making it a scrumptious flavorful absolutely delicious dish.

IngredientS

-

• **Chicken Thigh** – thoroughly wash _(with excess fat trimmed off_ ) and
chopped to slightly bigger than bite size.  
-  
• **Shiitake Mushrooms** – Soaked overnight and de-stemmed.  
-  
• **Fish Maw** – Amount really depends on individual preference _._ If using a
higher grade, it can be very expensive, so use sparingly. These are non-fried
smaller affordable Fish Maw tube.  
-  
• **Side Condiments** – A handful of Scallion and Parsley, cut to 2-inches
long. Sliced Red Chili. Sliced Ginger. Smashed Garlic. Triangular Onion.
Sliced Red Carrot. One Star Anise and a small stick of Cinnamon.  
-  
**Seasoning** - Good quality Light soy, Dark soy, Oyster sauce, Sugar, Salt,
Sesame Oil and a dash of Shaoxing Wine and white Pepper. A little Cornstarch
mixture as thickening agent if necessary. All to taste.

-

_** Note : Just a dash/pinch of everything, if U prefer a stronger intensity
of an ingredient/spice flavor, simply add a little extra of that
ingredient/spice - no rocket scientific measurement here. Always taste your
Seasoning !!! The trick is **NOT** the exact measurement, the trick is **" to
taste the Seasoning"** and get ur preference balance of flavors !!!_

InstructionS

①

-  
**_Preparing the Fish Maw and Mushrooms_**  
-  
• **Fish Maw**  
**-** Start by washing the Fish Maw and soak in clean water overnite.  
**-** Get a pot of water boiling with the Ginger and Scallion. Add Fish Maw
and let it boil for few mins. Remove from the heat and let it simmer till
water cool down. This will further soften the Fish Maw and also get rid of any
fishy smell and impurities. Cut to smaller pieces if too big.  
**-** Wash and squeeze off excess water and then resoak in clean cold water.
Set aside. The image on the right depicts the Fish Maw appearance in 3
different stages.  
-  
• **Mushroom**  
**-** First, soak the Dried Shiitake Mushrooms for abt 30 mins. Then, gently
squeeze and clean the mushrooms and discard the water.  
**-** Re-soak overnite. Keep the water this time and use it for the braising
process. Cut off the Stem but don’t discard them, braise it together with the
chicken, it’s pack with Mushroom’s flavor.  
-  
• **Optional** - **_While_ _U can simply Braise the Mushroom (straight from
soaking) together with the chicken (at the next stage) but these extra steps
will get the mushroom extra smooth and tender with a slightly crunchy
texture._**  
**- **With the soaked Mushroom slightly squeezed off excess water, marinate
with a some Sugar and Cornstarch, making sure everything is thoroughly work
into the Mushroom for about 15 mins. Thoroughly wash everything off and
squeeze dry.  
**- **With a little oil, saute the Mushroom with a few pieces of sliced Ginger
till aromatic. Then add the retained soaking water ( _generously cover the
Mushroom_ ) and boil on high heat till soften – abt 20-30 mins and water
render down to slightly thicken. U can also do this in advance. Set aside.
**_Hint : U can do a larger batch cos this will freeze well and U can use them
for other dishes._**

-  
**_Braising the Chicken_**  
-  
• On medium/low heat, start by sauteing the sliced Ginger, smashed Garlic,
triangular Onion, Star Anise, Cinnamon stick till aromatic. Add Chicken and
mix well and saute for a few minutes till the meat turn kinda whitish ( _not
cook_ ) and oil starts to render. Add the braised Mushrooms, bring to boil on
high heat.  
-  
• At this stage, The VianD like to transfer everything into a Claypot. Claypot
retains heat better and is best for slow gentle braising. Bring to boil and
turn heat to low, cover and simmer for 15-20 mins, depending on the preference
of texture ( _softness_ ) of the chicken.  
-  
• Then add the Fish Maw, mix well, bring to boil and let simmer for another 5
mins or so. Add the sliced Red Carrot, mix well. Add all Seasoning
Ingredients. Cover, turn off heat, ur pot of Chicken is basically done.

-

**_Serving_**  
-  
• When U are ready to serve, simply garnish with the sliced Chili and the rest
of the Scallion and Parsley. Serve in the Claypot itself - this makes it
really authentic and more importantly, keep ur pot of delicious **" Claypot
Mushroom/Fish Maw Chicken"** nice and warm.
