###  Clay-Pot Chicken In Oyster Sauce

A simple easy chicken dish, cooked in a claypot. This dish can be cooked in a
casserole pot if claypot is not available.  
  
  

  

According to the recipe, the chicken pieces is marinated and then roast in the
oven for 15 minutes until the skin is golden. I have however, brown the
chicken pieces over the stove. I cooked about 1 kg of chicken, enough for 6
persons as part of a meal with rice and other dishes.

  

After the chicken pieces are browned, they are braised together with the
mushrooms, chicken stock and braising sauce over low heat till the chicken is
tender.

  
  

  
This dish may be served directly from the claypot, or scooped into a serving
bowl.  
  
  

**_Clay-Pot Chicken in Oyster Sauce_**  
(from, A Spoonful of Ginger, Nina Simonds)  
Marinade  
2 tablespoons soy sauce  
2 tablespoons rice wine or sake  
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil  
4 whole scallions, ends trimmed, cut into 1-inch lengths  
2-inch chunk fresh ginger, peeled, then cut into 6 slices  
3-1/2 to 4 pounds chicken legs, thighs, wings, or assorted chicken parts,
rinsed and drained  
10 dried Chinese black mushrooms, steeped in hot water for 20 minutes until
soft, stems removed, caps cut into thirds (optional)  
  
Braising sauce (mixed together) ;  
1-1/2 cups chicken stock  
3 tablespoons oyster sauce  
3 tablespoons rice wine or sake  
1-1/2 teaspoon sugars (rock sugar, if available)  
about 1 teaspoon cornstarch dissolved in 1 tablespoon water (optional)  
  

  1. Mix the marinade ingredients in a large bowl, add the chicken pieces, and turn to coat them with the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes or longer in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 475F.
  2. Arrange the chicken pieces, with the marinade, and the drained black mushrooms on cookie sheet lined with aluminium foil. Roast for 15 minutes, turning once, until the skin is golden. Remove.
  3. Transfer the browned chicken and mushrooms to a clay pot, Dutch oven, or a casserole with a lid. Add the Braising Sauce and heat until the liquid is boiling. Reduce the heat to medium, partially cover, and cook for 45 minutes, until the meat is very tender. Skim any fat from the surface. The sauce should be slightly thick. If it hasn't thickened sufficiently, heat until boiling, add a little cornstarch dissolved in water, and cook, stirring, until the sauce has a smooth coating consistency. Scoop the chicken and sauce onto a serving platter or serve from the pot. Accompany the dish with a vegetable and rice.
