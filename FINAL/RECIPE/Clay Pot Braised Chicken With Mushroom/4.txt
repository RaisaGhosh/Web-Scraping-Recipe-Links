# Braised Chicken With Mushroom Hot Pot

  

  * Tweet
  *   * 

I cook for my lunch on weekdays for more than 6 months now. Yes, I seldom eat
out. One thing is it's healthier, it's also cheaper and I can embark on my
love for cooking almost daily. I usually prepare the food the night before and
I just need to heat it up when it's time to feed myself. I usually plan my 5
days meals on weekend and I go grocery shopping on weekend too and get what I
want for the whole 5 days. And when I encounter roadblocks on what to cook, I
look for inspiration everywhere. This time this inspiration come from a box of
Hokto mushroom which come with 2 recipes to try. This braised chicken with
mushroom hot pot is one of them. It's called hot pot I guess from the claypot
use (hot pot can also mean steamboat but no in this recipe).

This recipe is suppose to be cooked in a claypot but I don't have one that is
suitable (either too large or too small), so I used an enamel pot. The broth
is full of aromatic ginger which I love tremendously and if you're a fan of
ginger, this recipe is for you! Seriously I can't stop gulping down the broth.
üòõ

  
Braised chicken with mushroom hot pot.  
  
Let's cook!

  
Marinate chicken drumsticks a day in advance with oyster sauce, sesame oil,
sugar and pinch of black pepper.

  
Some of the ingredients clockwise from right: Chinese cabbage, wolfberries,
sliced ginger, mushrooms and leek.

  
Add cooking oil and sesame oil in a claypot (I use an enamel pot here). Saute
ginger until fragrance. Then add the chicken and stir occasionally until
cooked.

  
Then add leek, Chinese cabbage, wolfberries and mushrooms and cook with
occasional stirring for about 2-3 minutes. Add enough water to cover all the
ingredients and add salt.

Bring the liquid to boil and then cover the pot and simmer for 20 minutes in
low heat. Deliciously good with rice.

  
I shared this with my mom too and she loved it.
