Author: Han Ker

Recipe Type: Side

Serves: 2

Ingredients

For plain bun:

  * 400g Hong Kong Flour
  * 90g icing sugar
  * 30g butter (try to avoid using shortening as it's not good for health)
  * 10g baking powder
  * 10ml cold water
  * 7g instant dry yeast
  * 160ml lukewarm water
  * ½ tsp white vinegar

For Otak-Otak/ Luncheon Meat crabstick Fillings:

  * 100g frozen otak-otak
  * 50g fried luncheon meat (Cut into cubes)
  * 6 crabstick meat

Instructions

  1. Split evenly for all the otak-otak and luncheon meat crabstick filling. Set aside.
  2. Sift together flours and icing sugar. Place sifted flour mixture in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the middle.
  3. Fill well with lukewarm water and yeast. Add on vinegar.
  4. Use a spatula, gently stir the water to dissolve the yeast then slowly bring together flour mixture.
  5. Add in butter and knead for 10-15 minutes until soft dough is formed.
  6. Cover dough with damp cloth and let it rise for 30 minutes or until it is doubled in size. I used bread maker’s dough mode to prepare my dough up to this step.
  7. Dissolve baking powder in cold water, sprinkle over dough and knead until well combined. Divide dough into 16 equal portions and flatten with a rolling pin to make a 3” circle.
  8. Then place the filling in the middle, wrap and plead the top, seal side up.
  9. Arrange buns into a steamer, leave about 1” gab in between buns. Spray water mist over buns, and steam in a preheated steamer on high heat for 12 minutes. Remove buns from steamer and cool on rack to prevent soggy bottom.

Han Ker began baking since 8 years old with her mum, more after she started
her blog - Hankerie (http://www.hankerie.com) 2 years ago. She nonetheless
possesses a passion for baking and creating in the kitchen, and applies her
own creativity for crafting out her own recipes. Her specialty are pastries
and sweet treats, as well as bread – as evidenced by the goodies that come
from her kitchen. Determined to make the products of her creative imagination
a reality, Han Ker is a firm believer that nothing is impossible if you try
enough times. Apart from that, Blog-hopping has inspired her, and she shares
openly without a care for the jealous hoarding of information. She is
unendingly curious and is always seeking out new recipes to try, a method she
insists works great in keeping the brain juices flowing while at home. She is
truly a home baker of substance, a blogger, and cook with plenty to offer.
