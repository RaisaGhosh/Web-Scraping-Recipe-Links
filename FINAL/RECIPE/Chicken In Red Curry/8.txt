## **What is Thai Red Curry?**

**The Thai Red curry,** like the Green Curry is all about coconut milk, meat,
and vegetables. It can be soupy in texture unlike the creamy green curry.

This curry owes its red colour to the **predominant use of dry red chilies,**
which is simmered in coconut milk, where the coconut milk is the balancing
factor.

Thai Red Curry has more pungent and earthy flavours with garlic, shallots, soy
sauce or fish sauce, shrimp paste, fresh galangal, lemongrass, Coriander root,
cumin seeds, coriander seeds, Kaffir lime leaves, Thai Basil and of course,
dry red chillies.

Meat like chicken, beef, pork, duck, or seafood like shrimp or fish can be
added with or without vegetables. If not, tofu can be replaced for a vegan
protein.

For my curry, I have used chicken; apart from being biased to **my all-time
favourite protein,** I believe chicken has deep flavours, that also
intensifies this dish. As complex as it may sound, it is easy to make and if
you can’t get all the ingredients, you can always use the readily available
Thai red curry paste

## **Why Thai Red Curry recipe?**

  1. This curry, like the Green Curry is also gluten-free and the red curry paste is of inspired flavours, that will require a few more ingredients and a little more effort, if you want to make it by yourself. Anyway, what is worth it if there is no work.
  2. Curry pastes are traditionally pounded in a **mortar and pestle,** till you get that fine texture. Get your mortar and pestle out; it is the secret tool for having an edge over other recipes and it will always come in handy. If not, the blender is always your life saver.
  3. Thai Red curry recipe makes a **warm happy meal** for the whole family and can be stored in for later.

## How to make Thai Red Curry with Chicken:

These all the ingredients to make Thai red curry with chicken.  
Add peanut oil to your pan, add chopped garlic, crushed galangal, and
lemongrass.  
Let it cook for few seconds till the aromas of the garlic are evident.  
Add 1/4 cup of Thai Red curry paste.  
Stir and cook for 5 minutes till the raw smell of the masala leaves off. You
can see a thin layer of oil appears on the sides of the pan.  
That’s when you add chicken…  
cook for 5 minutes with the masala. Stirring occasionally. Mix well.  
Add coconut milk  
Add required amount of water (if needed). Add sugar and salt.  
Add kaffir leaves  
Add vegetables, carrots, and beans. Cover and cook for 7 to 8 minutes.  
Add Thai Basil and coriander leaves. Turn off the heat. Cover and let it sit
for 5 minutes. The aromas of Thai basil and coriander leaves will get infused
in Thai curry.

## **Expert Tips**

Some of the tips that I had mentioned for the Thai Green curry are the same
for this dish too and are added here again for your reference.

  * When choosing your favourite veggies, choose the softer ones that cook faster; and make sure to cut your vegetables in similar and smaller sizes for even and fast cooking
  * For that extra crunch, sauté the veggies first before adding them to the curry
  * Much of the flavour of lemon grass is in its lower stalks; trim the top and use most of the bottom stalk (say up to 5 inches)
  * If you are adding tofu, ensure the firmness of the tofu before use or else it will crumble when it cooks
  * For that rich creaminess in your curry, the coconut milk should not be compromised; full fat coconut milk is the tip
  * Fish sauce is added to give the saltiness
  * You can always alter the spiciness of this dish by adding more coconut milk
  * Soaking the chillies will reduce its heat and will also make the dish flavourful
  * When adding chicken, gently poach the chicken in the coconut milk, this makes it tender
  * If you’re reducing the number of chillies, the colour of the dish also may change; hence to retain the red colour, tomato sauce or chilli powder can play the trick.

## **Health Benefits** of Red curry Recipe:

  1. The coconut milk is fattening, but it is good fat. Coconut milk lowers bad cholesterol and promotes good cholesterol
  2. Many of the ingredients in the curry paste are of medicinal value, thereby helps in maintaining a healthy body.
  3. The core ingredient – red chillies, they possess a high content in potassium that helps in regulating blood pressure, help in burning calories, support the immune system because of its Vitamin C content and help in preventing heart ailments.

## **Note**

  1. The heat of the curry will vary according to the region from where the red chillies are grown.
  2. You can use any protein or vegetable that will suit the cooking time and method of this curry. Some of the vegetarian variations are Eggplants, Zucchini, Green Beans, Cauliflower, Asparagus, Carrots, and Potatoes, Pumpkin, Snow Peas, Mushrooms or Red Bell Peppers. You can also play around with combinations that will go well with each other.
  3. If going vegan, instead of fish sauce, use a light soy sauce and exclude the shrimp paste. A good substitute for Kaffir lime leaves is a lemongrass stalk or chopped lemon zest

## **FAQ**
