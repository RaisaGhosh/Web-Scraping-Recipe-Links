## About This Recipe

Thai Red Chicken Curry is a spicy Coconut Milk Curry that can be found on the
menu of every Thai Restaurant.

Full of flavor and aroma, this Red Curry is one of the most popular Coconut
Milk Curries from Thai Cuisine, which is loved all over the world.

It is a one-pot deliciousness, that will surely satisfy your taste buds.
Ingredients like Lemon Grass, Ginger, Garlic, Fish Sauce, etc are added in
this curry which makes it so aromatic, that the smell of this dish will only
make you hungry.

It is a great Gluten-Free Recipe, that can be made for your weeknight dinners
or can also be made for your house parties or special occasions.

It is also a great recipe to make on the days when you want to eat something
delicious and easy.

You can make it vegan by skipping fish sauce and adding veggies and tofu
instead of meat.

This Thai Curry is,

  * Delicious
  * Quick & Easy
  * Gluten-Free
  * Just like the restaurant one
  * A great dish for your weekday meals

## Ingredients

**Chicken** – The protein in this dish is Chicken. Wash and clean the boneless
chicken and then cut into small pieces to add in the curry.

**Vegetables** – Along with the chicken, we will also add some vegetables such
as Bell Pepper, Broccoli, but you can go ahead and add more vegetables of your
choice.

**Thai Red Curry Paste** – You can either make Thai Red Curry paste at home
and store for everyday use. If you are short on time, you can even use the
store-bought red curry paste. I like the homemade version as it is fresh and
free of preservatives.

**Coconut Milk** – Use the thin coconut milk for this curry. Again, you can
make it at home or use the store-bought one. If the store-bought one is too
thick, you can add water to thin it out.

**Fish Sauce** – When it comes to sauce, we will use fish sauce. But if you
are looking for a vegan option, you can use soy sauce instead.

**Oil** – You can use any vegetable oil or even olive oil to make this
delicious curry.

**Chicken Stock** – Chicken Stock adds an extra flavor, but if you do not have
it, you can even use vegetable stock or water instead.

**Basil** – Add in a handful of Thai Basil to add an authentic taste. If you
cannot find Thai Basil, you can even use Italian Basil instead.

**Other Ingredients** – Apart from these ingredients, you will need ginger,
garlic, onion, brown sugar, cilantro, red chili, and tamarind paste. These
ingredients combined add a spicy, tangy, and sweet taste.

## Step By Step Recipe

Heat oil in a pan. Once the oil is hot, add garlic, ginger, and onion and fry
for a minute.

Add Thai Red Curry Paste and cook for 2-3 minutes on medium heat.

Add chicken stock and bring the mixture to a boil.

Now add bell pepper, broccoli and chicken and cook for 3-4 minutes.

Add coconut milk, fish sauce and brown sugar and cook for 2 minutes.

Add tamarind paste and cook for another minute. Garnish with coriander and red
chilli. Serve hot with steamed rice.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What can you add instead of Chicken in this curry?**

You can add Shrimp or Fish in this Restaurant quality 20 minute Thai Curry,
but if you are vegetarian, you can add Tofu along with other vegetables such
as Carrot, Red, Yellow Or Green Bell Pepper, Mushrooms, etc.

**How To make Red Thai Curry Paste?**

Any ingredient that is made fresh and used in the recipe always enhances the
taste and flavor of the dish. So here, we will tell you how to make Thai Red
Curry paste at home. It is super easy to make and gets ready in no time.  
  
 **Ingredients** :  
3 Birds Eye Chilli or Thai Red Chilli, finely chopped (can be adjusted
according to the spice level)  
2 Fresh Red Chillies or Dry Red Chillies  
1 Tablespoon Coriander Seeds  
1 Teaspoon Cumin Seeds  
1 Teaspoon Whole Black Peppercorns  
2 Fresh Lemongrass, discard the outer leaves and chop it finely  
2 inch Ginger or Galangali, finely chopped  
5 to 6 cloves Garlic  
2 Pearl Onions, roughly chopped  
5 to 6 Thai Basil/ Kaffir Lime Leaves/ Basil Leaves  
½ Teaspoon Lemon Zest or Lemon Juice (optional)  
Salt, as required  
2 Tablespoons Coconut Milk or Water  
  
 **Instructions:**  
To make the paste, add all the ingredients in the mixer grinder jar and grind
it to make a fine paste. Once ready, take it out in a bowl and keep it aside
to use in the Curry.

**How to make this curry in Slow Cooker?**

If you want to make Red Thai Curry in Slow Cooker, then you can add in all the
ingredients at once in the cooker, mix it well and let it cook it for 2 to 3
hours on high or 5 to 6 hours on low.  
  
The best part about slow cooking is, you can make it without using oil.  
Also, if you want to thicken the curry, you can take out some curry and mix it
with the cornflour.  
  
Add this again in the curry and cook it further for 30 minutes. It is always
good to use less water, only the amount which can cover up your chicken and
vegetables, so that the water doesn’t come out of the cooker.

**What is the difference between Thai Red and Green Curry?**

The difference between both the Thai Curries is their colour and the chillies
used to make these quick and easy curries.  
  
Thai Red Curry uses Dry and Fresh Red Chillies, whereas Thai Green Curry uses
fresh Green Chillies. I have a homemade Thai Green Curry Paste recipe on the
blog which you should check as well.

**How to make a Low Calorie Red Thai Curry?**

For a low calorie version, you can make the Red Thai Curry Paste at home and
use half fat coconut milk in the curry.

**Which Thai Curry is spiciest?**

Green Thai Curry is considered to be spicier as it uses green chillies, which
is spicy that the red chillies used in the Red Thai Curry.  
  
Red Thai Curry comes the seconds and the least spicy is Yellow Thai Curry.

## Storage Suggestions

This Thai Curry tastes the best when served fresh. But if you have leftovers,
you can store it in the fridge for about 2-3 days in an air tight container.

I will not suggest you to freeze the same, as it has coconut milk. While
thawing, the coconut milk tend to split, which will alter the texture of the
curry and won’t taste good.

## Serving Suggestions

You can serve Red Thai Curry along with Jasmine Rice, which also adds a flavor
of its own.

You can also serve it along with Sticky Rice, Steamed White Rice or Brown
Rice. For a healthy alternative, you can also serve it with Quinoa and
Couscous.

Really simple to make, just make sure you prep all ingredients.  
It’s wasn’t burn your mouth off hot  
Will definitely make this again.  
The only thing I did was to put cherry tomatoes in in the last few minutes at
the same time as the tamarind paste.

Hi,

This looks delish. Planning on making it on Saturday. How many people is the
recipe for? Should it be doubled when we are four people?

Thanks!

Hello Hege. This recipe serves 2-3. You can easily double to serve 4-5 people.

reduce it a half hour later. 🙂 in our case the coconut milk was sufficient.

Help! I think you changed this recipe. I swear it used to have basil and
broccoli and I LOVED that version but never printed it! I just always came to
the blog when I made it. And now it’s different! Do you still have a copy of
the original?

will like it as well. Updated the basil part.
