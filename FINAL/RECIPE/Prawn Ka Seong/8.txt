_**Any chef worth his salt would be able to advise you on how the seasonality
of the ingredients is important for a meal or for a restaurant per se.**_

Similarly , any home cook or simply a caring mother will be able to tell you
the secrets behind the wonderful seasonal produce and how they benefit the
health as well as the taste of any dish.

> Talk to an Indian cuisine chef, or an oriental, a continental chef or the
> most famous or those just starting their trade, each will know the
> importance of using fresh and seasonal produce. It shouldn't take much
> convincing to let you know that seasonality of the ingredients is important,
> and there are various reasons why the chef's prowess in the kitchen is not
> just restricted to how he plates the food, or how it tastes on the palate,
> chef's job is much deeper and takes the whole heart & soul to produce a meal
> which is beneficial to the guests eating, the restaurant owner, the farmers,
> the commis, the servers and almost everyone involved in the process.

Summer is the hottest season of the year and it takes a lot to fight the
summers. Fresh & Healthy food is more than just a good start.

Before we start with our analysis let me give you a glimpse of what lies
ahead.

_**To begin with, there are few important points/ questions to understand and
we will focus on them in this analysis:**_

_**1\. The Reasons and thoughts behind seasonal menus**_

_**2\. How seasonality of ingredients affect different cuisines**_

_**3\. What are different ways hotels and restaurants are preparing their
summer seasonal menus?**_

_**4\. To Understand the culinary visions and ideologies of Iconic Chefs and
their successful restaurants**_

_**5\. Some Interesting recipes for Our readers and some magic tips on healthy
eating**_

### _**Our Analysis**_

We met a lot of chefs and management of hotels/restaurants and various
important people who gave us lots of meaningful insights on seasonal menus,
ingredients, ideologies, experiences and summer recipes.

While there were, off course, some similar views and common practices followed
by each one of them, we did find ways unique to them and certain practices and
vision which are inspiring and enriching. Thus, to all our readers in all the
states and countries, "there is something here for everyone".

**This Broadly Showcases the results analysing the following 5 aspects/trends
to understand the effect of seasonal produce and their application in
different cuisines.**

_**1\. Mangoes and its role**_  
_**2\. Japanese Cuisine and its healthy practices**_  
_**3\. Innovations and freshness of Western Cuisines**_  
_**4\. Indigenous Indian Cuisine, its Regionality and Seasonality**_  
_**5\. Last but not the least some wonderful summer special recipes of our
iconic chefs prepared with fresh, healthy and flavourful ingredients**_

###  _**1\. Mangoes: The saviour of summers**_

In India, Mangoes are the King, The King of fruits. Come summers and we all
are ready to enjoy the variety of mangoes available and variety of different
dishes that are made with it. It may surprise you how versatile our not so
humble Mango is, when you'll know how chefs are using it in their menus.

### Spice Route, The Imperial Hotel, New Delhi

During our meeting with Chef Veena

I was with **Chef Veena** , The Iconic Chef of **Spice Route** at **The
Imperial Hotel** , who, in the past 20+ years has created various different
menus periodically to ensure that freshest and healthiest ingredients go in
her dishes, which stands out as the USP of her restaurant. On her menu, this
season, we can find Mangoes beautifully marrying the cuisine.

Enjoy the **Rassam with riped mangoes** , her famous **Raw mango salad** **,
Irachi Manghai Curry** - Chef’s special Kerala style mutton curry cooked with
raw mangoes, _**GA XAO HOT DIEU**_ - Stir-fried Chicken with fresh Mangoes &
Cashew Nuts Vietnamese Style.

Being born and brought up in the fruit friendly Thailand, Chef Veena
encompassses the styles of a legendary chef of an iconic restaurant as well as
that of a caring mother who wants to feed you the healthier fresher stuff,
subtly without going overboard with it.

Her simplicity in nature and style of her dishes is an ideal showcase of how
seasonal produce should be pursued in the kitchens.

Chef Veena explains her summer menu saying, " _Most of them are my own
creations, wonderfully complemented by rice, chicken, prawns, sole fish,
veggies and exotic spices. While mangoes are not integral to Thai cuisine, the
fruit is abundant in the season and that’s why the complete menu revolves
around it in its own unique way, be it the mango pulp blended perfectly in
appams or the raw mango Sri Lankan curry with lentils which is also one of my
nouvelle creations this year. I have somehow tried to keep the fruit central
to the palette layering and balancing it with other flavours.”_

Vietnamese Style (Recipe Attached)

_**PLA –E- SAAN** _Crispy fillets of Sole served with spicy palm sugar sauce
and garnished with shredded raw mango. ( Recipe Attached )

Coconut water served at Spice Route is another lovely way to beat the summer
heat, and add to the nutritiousness of the meal.

### How Important are mangoes ?

> Mangoes are no stranger to restaurant menus and this season, too, mango is a
> key weapon for chefs to fight the scorching hot weather.

### Cafe Delhi Heights : Mango-licious

Chef Tyson of Cafe Delhi Heights

One of Delhi's favourite cafes, **Cafe Delhi Height 's Executive Chef**,
**Tyson** , gave a great tip for the hot summers. He says, _ "One needs to
keep in mind what summer beaten customers would be looking for when they enter
the restaurant. In the scorching heat of Delhi, one needs refreshments that
will help them forget what temperature there is outside of their little world
they are sitting in. The knowledge that our grandmothers have bestowed upon
all of us, we sometimes forget"._

> Reference to mangoes as the 'food of the gods' can be found in the Hindu
> Vedas, written in about 4000 B.C.

Apart from the Mangolicious festival Cafe Delhi Heights has a variety of
really cool summer drinks and dishes which take care of this aspect.

Summer Coolers at Cafe Delhi Heights

### Taj Mahal Hotel, Mansingh Road, New Delhi

**Mangoes are the flavour of the season at The Iconic Taj Mahal Hotel too, as
they too celebrate the Mango Mania this summers.**

Chef Arun Sundararaj, The Executive Chef, who has joined the Taj Mahal Hotel,
New Delhi recently from the Falaknuma Palace, Hyderabad explains Machan's
Menu. He says, _ ** "Keeping in mind the soaring temperature, We have devised
a perfect summer menu that comprises of light and crunchy salads, melt in your
mouth sorbets, flavorsome granitas and exotic cold soups. Apart from Machan,
we also offer a great variety of iced teas and frappes at Emperor’s Lounge."

### EN- The Japanese Restaurant, Qutub

### The Mango Sushi

**Japanese Expat Chef Honda Kazuya at EN- The Japanese Restaurant** has
beautifully melanged the king of fruit with Japanese delicacies like Sushis
and sashimis. They have an exciting combination of Mango Cocktails, Mango
Sushis and Mango Desserts for their guests this summer, apart from various
other summer cocktails and dishes.

### #SidAnalysis

> Mangoes are the cheapest and taste the best in Summers. Such Mango Festivals
> not only entices the guests to enjoy the kingly feast but also keep
> restaurant's costings low by focusing on seasonal and local produce than
> promoting imported or non-seasonal ingredients.

**Thus, Mango makes more sense than we think it does on a restaurant menu and
it harms no one. Mango, indeed, controls cholesterol, has anti-cancer
properties, helps in weight loss, is an aphrodisiac, helps in eye care, helps
in digestion, prevents heat stroke, aids concentration & memory, is a source
of high iron, reduces kidney stones, is a perfect snack and above all is
pretty damn tasty.**

### _**2\. Japanese Cuisine : Inspiring health**_

The single most factor which made Japanese cuisine trend the world over is its
health benefits.

Japanese cuisine, traditionally, is light, uses minimal seasonings, uses
vegetables in plenty and seafood is the most preferred non vegetarian choice.
Cooking oils are rarely used except for the Tempura preparations, which are of
Portuguese Origin.

The Trend of Japanese cuisine has inspired healthy and nutritious cooking
across the world.

> It is a common culture in Japan of taking advantage of the 'fruits of the
> season' ( _yama no sachi)_ ('bounty of the mountains') (e.g. bamboo shoots
> in spring, chestnuts in the fall) as well as the 'fruits of the sea' ( _umi
> no sachi)_ ('bounty of the sea'). Thus, the first catch of skipjack tunas
> that arrives with the Kuroshio Current has traditionally been greatly
> prized.

### Megu, The Leela Palace, New Delhi

Chef Yutaka Saito of Megu

Owing to the tradition of seasonal produce and usage of fresh ingredients _
**Chef Saito**_ of _**Megu, At The Leela Palace Hotel,**_ has introduced a
fresh seasonal menu which showcases several new creations well balanced with
the Megu Signature dishes.

Salmon Daikon, Yuzu Akami, Crispy Chicken, Seared Rock Lobster, Shitake
Asparagus, Corn Fed Chicken Breast, Grilled Sea Bass, Grilled Lamb Chops and

As a special tribute to vegetarians and healthy preferences, the new menu
includes special rolls like **Avocado and Cucumber** , **Vegetable Rainbow,
Enoki Tempura Roll, Green California Roll, Avocado Tempura Roll** and
**Asparagus Tempura.**

### What do we know ?

Japanese cuisine, thus, in its traditional forms, lays a great emphasis on
seasonality, fresh produce, healthy ingredients served with minimal seasonings
and oil. Yet the flavours of Japanese cuisine, be it from the Soy sauce and
sugar, wasabi and dashi, sake or mirin, seaweed, the rice or the miso soup,
all have successfully enthralled the world and are continuing to do so.

### Guppy By Ai: _harmony, tradition, wisdom and balance_

**At Guppy by Ai, Chef Vikram Khatri,** too, is taking things a notch higher
by presenting his summer menu with light, healthy, fresh & delicious new
dishes. _His menu embodies the four essential elements of cooking: harmony,
tradition, wisdom and balance. They too agree on using fresh produces to make
the food flavourful, and thus, embodies the japanese lifestyle of health and
well being through food traditions. Chef Vikram has used fresh and seasonal
ingredients like Cherry Blossom flowers, Tokasa Seaweed, Kobocha, Yellowtail,
Angel hair somen noodles and Water chestnut._

Tofu and Water Chestnut Motoyaki

Futomaki Sushi Roll

Their summer menu includes Sakura, Wood Smoked Pumpkin Soup, Seaweed and
Mesclun Salad, Salmon Tartar, Cold Soba or Udon Noodles served with Bonito Soy
Broth, Chilled Ramen Noodles topped with prawn and crab stick, Hiyashi Somen,
Tofu and Water Chestnut Motoyaki, Yellowtail Nigiri and much more of such
delicious offerings.

### _**#SidAnalysis**_

_**Thus, when it comes to summer food and seasonal produce, Japanese cuisine
is a great option for you, and restaurants like Megu , Guppy by Ai a**_ _
**nd**_ **even** _ **the Lesser Known EN-The Japanese restaurant are offering
great options to** **the diners.**_

### #OperationalExcellence

**Ravi Shahani, The Manager at EN** , explains us the importance of correct
procurement and storage of produce in the sensitive summers especially for
their sushis and sashimis.

**At EN, Sushi Expert like Chef Honda Kayazu** comes really handy to carry a
summer menu with ease, comfort and high quality production.

### Pan Asian, ITC Sheraton Hotel

Chef Vaibhav Bhargava of Pan Asian, ITC Sheraton Hotel

> ITC Sheraton, the winner of Masterchef International Cuisine Award in 2009,
> is one of the most talked about chefs of the city, while he talks about

other summer friendly preparations.

### _**3\. Western Cuisines: from an artist 's eye **_

### Hotel Dusit Devarana

To understand how various other cuisines adapt to changing seasons, i spoke to
Chef _**Nishant Choubey,**_ who has become quite a sensation in Delhi with the
culinary success of restaurants at _ **Dusit Devarana.**_

> Nishant's outlook towards his cuisine is very fresh, as his method of
> producing each of his dishes is, with utmost care and progressive
> innovation.

Nishant Kumar Choubey, Executive Chef, Dusit Devarana New Delhi

Nishant says, "Key features of his summer seasonal menu are: _ **Fresh, light
, healthy, low calorie , cold and organic ".**_

This mantra, as simple as it may sound, takes care of most aspects of a menu
prepared by an experienced chef, where the wellness is pronounced with each
morsel of the dish, being made from organic and fresh produce, served in
soothing temperatures and satiate the health as well as the dietary demands of
summers.

Favouring the Seasonal menus Nishant says, _ ** "Chefs should change the menu
according to seasons as it gives the chefs and the team an opportunity to
create something nouvelle and also for guests to try out something different
and interesting"**_

### _**Le Cirque - The Leela Palace , New Delhi **_

_**Le Cirque is the Most expensive restaurant of Delhi**_ , and is definitely
the most celebrated French-Italian Restaurant of the city. Le cirque commands
high level of detailing, highest quality and freshest ingredients and a
showcase of a cuisine in a way which is par excellence.

Chef Diego Martinelli, of Le Cirque

Thus, the task with the newly appointed **Chef Diego Martinelli** was to take
things a notch higher and as we learnt, he has taken it higher by two. A
complete makeover has been given to the menu with new and exciting flavours,
ingredients and colours which showcases a fresh line of creativity and
excellence in culinary art.

### #DiegosMagic

32 years old Chef, who has worked in hotels like **Four seasons in London** ,
**Bulgari in Bali** and one of my favourites, **The Fullerton Hotel in
Singapore** brings his experience on the platter using local herbs and spices,
farm fresh vegetables, clever usage of perfectly cut meats to prepare his
handcrafted culinary delicacies including **Lobster Ravioli, Risotto Alla
Cipolla, Yellowfin Tuna, Sea Bass in Crispy Potato Paupiette and Chicken Al
Mattone.**

Plenty of vegan options adorns his menu like Pumpkin soup, tasty Zucchini,
Frittelle, Capellini, Fritto Misto and Risotto Ai Carcifio

indulgences** , his favourite being his signature **Pumpkin Tortelloni** (in
the pic) with its **sweet flavour and texture** , the **Sage Pappardelle
Pasta** for **comfort food** and **Pork Belly** with **richness** in its

### _**Olive Bar & Kitchen , Qutub **_

Chef Sujan Sarkar at Olive Bar & Kitchen

_**Chef Sujan Sarkar at Olive Qutub** _has launched their summer menu
focussing on local produce, simple flavors, colour, more fruit and vegetables,
lean meat and fish, sweet and sour combination.

### What Sujan says

> At Olive we change our menu twice a year based on availability of fresh and

_**" Our Vision is to produce healthy, nutritious food based on slow food
principal".**_ says Sujan.

### _**What did we understand ?**_

> Till this point, we have ascertained the growing importance for healthy,
> light & flavourful cuisines, some useful and meaningful insight into the
> ingredients, cultures & traditions, methodology, vision and ideology of
> various chefs and their establishments, explaining the basics of how to
> create a summer menu and what to focus on, which ingredients make the menu
> light and healthy, the styles of cooking which is different and unique as
> well as some progressive ideas on cuisine, ingredients and its uses.

I, then, spoke to few people who are my friends, to whom i also look up to at
the same time for their hard work, vision and most importantly, i connect with
them well, for carrying an outlook quite similar to mine.

### A Candid Discussion with Chef Apoorva Kunte from The Westin, Dhaka

So My _**College Friend** _and an _ **Ex Colleague at Taj**_ , _ **Chef
Apoorva Kunte,**_ who then went on to work with _**Ritz Carlton**_ and is now
heading the kitchens at _ **Westin**_ in _**Dhaka,**_ is a chef with great
attitude, as i remember him talking with passion about food from the time we
were in college and thus, we spoke to understand how he operates his kitchens.

### When i asked Apoorva about what he keeps in mind while preparing a
seasonal menu he enlists:

> I use regional and local summer produce, the ingredients that are simple
> sugars, that are easy to break down, thus, helping the body gain energy
> faster during the summer heat. I use a lot of citrus flavours and liquids in
> the menu to help keep the body hydrated, I use these vitamin rich
> ingredients or such ingredients that generate thirst like an aperitif in
> your bar, tantalizes the taste buds, and make you want to have more.
>
> I also lay focus on small and tasting portions so not to make the guest feel
> bloated and lethargic.

### _**Apoorva is a big supporter of seasonal menus and he explain to me
saying:**_

Chef Apoorva Kunte from Westin, Dhaka

> _I have been in the kitchens for 10 years now and have seen a changing trend
> of menus. I personally feel that the menus should change with the produce of
> the season. I make it a point to go visit the main fruit/vegetable/meat
> market on my days off to analyze what produce/ingredients are available and
> change my menus and offerings according to them. I constantly push my
> purchasing department to get the best quality of the seasonal produce so a
> consistent menu output can be maintained for my guests. I would rather have
> a smaller menu with best quality seasonal produce than 10 page menu where
> products are coming out of a deep freezer._

Golgappa with aam panna sorbet by Chef Apoorva Kunte

On being quizzed on the guest response to seasonal menus, he says, "The
guests' outlook towards seasonal menus has also changed. Our discerning guests
are well traveled and understand ingredients and their availability and,
hence, have accepted the seasonal menus because they know its the best produce
for the season rather than an all year produce like watermelons that are
pumped with enzymes and enhancers to have them available."

In this candid chat , it came out clear how non season ingredients are being
despised by people across the world , and even in the subcontinent its no
difference.

### _**4\. Indian Cuisine: its regionality & seasonality **_

### Turban Tadka With Chef Harpal Singh Sokhi "The Energy of India"

Celebrity Chef and Food Show Presenter, Chef Harpal Singh Sokhi

> Chef Harpal Singh Sokhi is a household name in India, and I am one of his
> biggest fans. I totally adore his ideology and style of cooking. He is
> always happy when he is cooking and often grooves to his own culinary tunes
> like 'Namak Shamak, namak shamak daal dete hain' ('Let us add some salt',
> sung in a poetic way) and his simple approach towards cooking delicious as
> well as nutritious meals.

#SidAnaysis: "His style of cooking is what i call in my language as the
'Bhangra Cuisine', something which you cook with your heart, mind and soul and
the taste which makes you groove to its tunes"

Chef Harpal is a treasure trove of knowledge on Indian cuisine and its various
ingredients and their rightful uses. An interaction with him added a whole new
meaning to my analysis.

### Hello Friends, You should drink more water !!

Chef Harpal's agenda starts with _' water'_, as he explains its importance in
staying hydrated in summers for energy as well as your skin to look radiant
and beautiful

He emphasizes on the usage of fruits like _watermelon, melon, oranges,
pineapple, apple, cucumber, peppers, salad greens, tomatoes, peas, lemon,
berries, carrots_ etc. and vegetables like _doodh (bottlegourd), parhwal
(pointedgourd)_ and _pumpkins_ as they are full of fibre and are easy to
digest. He suggests _spinach_ and _mushrooms_ apart from _cucumber_ ,
_tomatoes_ and _carrot_ as water rich vegetables. Thus, water content as well
as fibrous vegetables are key ingredients for an Ideal Indian Menu in summers.

you can also find on his menus variety of lassis like _oreo lassi, banana
lassi, ferrero rochers lassi_ and _Merrut wali nimbu shikanki._ Now who
doesn't like such drinks in summers?

### Gyan from the guru

Chef Harpal shares key mantras for menu engineering and selection of dishes &
ingredients:

  * **_Menu should be made keeping in mind the operations and its management_**
  * **_Must satisfy guest expectations_**
  * **_Should reflect guests’ tastes, food preferences and needs_**
  * **_Must be cost effective_**
  * **_Should match production requirements in terms of quality, staff productivity, skills and timing_**
  * **_Balanced with profit earning and popular items and maintaining the Menu Mix to cater to varied demands_**
  * **_Should promote innovation and creativeness_**
  * **_Seasonal availability of the ingredient_**

### #SidAnalysis

Various cuisines use various ingredients. However, fundamental culinary
requirements of each cuisine remain similar as was evident from the views of
chefs of the industry who have worked in different countries, different styles
of restaurants and different cuisines.

> We all learnt through this analysis how special seasonal menus are made to
> cater to the demand of the weather and the guests. However, such fundamental
> thoughts should be applied on regular basis by restaurant's management

_**#SidAnalysis**_ : "Fresh, local, regional, healthy, organic ingredients
provide nutrients to form a balanced diet. It is important to understand the
availability of ingredients and prepare menus anticipating the supply. So
while seasonal promotions are a good way to lure the guests and ensuring that
fresh ingredients are used and showcased, this must not remain to be a
seasonal act, rather, it should be a continuous practice, which makes up as
the soul of the restaurant. We can then successfully do a festival every month
or every quarter/changing season and showcase our ideology to the world."

### Words of Wisdom with Rahul Dua, At Cafe Lota

My Dear Friend Rahul Dua of Cafe lota is another person i have been connected
with for a long time, and his ideology and outlook towards hospitality
industry is what i have always admired.

> I want to make a special mention of Cafe Lota, as this is one restaurant
> which has found great success on the basis of using fresh, local and often
> cheaply priced produce and creates simple, nutritious, authentic yet
> progressive Indian cuisine.

### _**Rahul shares his ideology on seasonal ingredients saying:**_

_**At Café Lota, our biggest guiding visions are 'Regionality' and
'Seasonality'. While, it seems that almost all ingredients are now available
throughout the year, the quality greatly suffers due to prolonged duration of
time spent in cold storage chambers which takes away from the natural flavours
and nutrients in the ingredients. Seasonality in India is quite challenging,
as availability is not well defined due to various issues in agricultural
practices, supply-chain, etc. For example, a lot of ingredients I would like
to include on a summer menu actually don't show up in markets before June/July
and then its time for the Monsoon menu! So, we approach seasons not as Summer,
Winter, Spring or Autumn but rather on a monthly basis based on market
availability.**_

### _**Some of the ingredients/dishes that cafe lota have in the summers
are:**_

_**- Bel (wood apple) sherbet**_

_**- Aam Panna**_

_**- Kacha aam prawn curry**_

_**- Mango Kheer**_

_**- Pineapple Sheera**_

_**- Kamal Kakdi raita**_

_**- Kathal Biryani (soon to be replaced by Parval Biryani as Kathal season
ends soon)**_

_**- Kachha papita koshimbir (An Indian interpretation of Raw Papaya salad)**_

_****_

_**Apart from these, they 've introduced a couple of simple and light
dishes:**_

_****_

_**- Dal, Dhokli, batata nu shaak**_

_**- Panch-phoron and pumpkin khichdi**_

_**- Also, the Aaj ki Sabji made at the restaurant everyday is mostly a
simple, home-style seasonal vegetable**_

Rahul adds, _" As we move into July, some of these dishes will be changed and
modified according to what is available in the market. In my opinion,
Seasonality should not be treated like a marketing tool, where restaurants
come up with a 'special menu' to drive business. Instead, Seasonality should
be a commitment and firmly engrained in the restaurants guiding vision. It
requires an extra bit of effort in the short-term but it definitely pays
off."_

###  Summer-y Summary

> Rahul's vision has helped him attain great success for Cafe Lota, and
> similarly for each of the chefs with whom we discussed at length to
> understand the fundamentals of the Seasonality & Regionality.
>
> So While Chef Veena of Spice Route continuously introduces new dishes and
> menus to keep the dishes fresh and healthy, seasonal fruits like mangoes
> have been the focus of her as well as chefs at Taj, Westin, and several
> standalone restaurants serving different cuisines.
>
> Megu, Guppy by Ai, EN and Pan Asian, few of the best Oriental restaurants of
> the city thrive on fresh produce, seasonal ingredients, ingredients which
> are more suitable and represents the traditions, cultures and culinary
> practices of their cuisines.
>
> You learnt how world class chefs like Diego Martinelli, Nishant Choubey,
> Apoorva Kunte and Sujan Sarkar are using their experience to manage their
> kitchens on high quality culinary practices and artistic use of ingredients
> which are Fresh , light and organic. Such principles are making them
> successful and reach culinary pinnacles at a very young age. This does
> explains us where fundamentals of culinary art can take you.
>
> Chef Harpal spoke about the water content in ingredients and how to keep the
> menu profitable for guests as well as management, and consider seasonal
> menus as an opportunity to innovate and invent new dishes.
>
> Its not a difficult thing to do, rather this comes most naturally to an
> experienced chef, and while it may not be rocket science, it does require
> lot of attention, hard work, focus and culinary art to prepare dishes
> keeping in mind all the techniques of cooking, their temperatures, their
> taste, their doneness, their presentation, the garnishes, the time of
> cooking, the plating, the hygiene and then, above all, the responsibility to
> ensure what goes on the guests' table is the freshest, the most nutritious
> and an innovative product, thus ensuring it exceeds the expectations of the
> guests.

Its not an easy job, so this summer, let's have a chilled drink on the rocks
for our chefs. Cheers !!

https://www.facebook.com/groups/152792394924369/ Short Note on Why i Began
This. I am a hospitality professional and i am extremely passionate about the
same , My quest to work and learn as many restaurants , cuisines , topics as
possible motivated me to not remain confined to hotel jobs and dive into the
whole wide world of gastronomy , mixology , travel , food , cultures , spirits
, wines , hospitality trends and so much more of the beautiful things our
hospitality industry has to offer. Writing about the same was only a matter of
no choice , as its through sharing knowledge that one can learn more and more.
I also believe in the value that Hospitality indutry is like my mother , as
the industry feeds me and helps me make my bread & butter, thus writing blogs
,initiating/ Participating in discussions ,help market a new interesting
concept or helping a suffering one with my inputs are my simple ways of giving
back to the industry. The experience has been great as I, in the short string
of 2 years has been able to positively contribute to the industry ( In
whichever small ways i choose to do) and has in due course improved my
knowledge and understanding of the industry.
