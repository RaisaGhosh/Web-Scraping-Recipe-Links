## Instructions

    * circle-smallEmail
    * Soak your choice of wood chips in water for at least 30 minutes (we used apple wood chips). 

    * Prepare the barbecue for indirect cooking over medium heat (180°C to 230°C). If using a Weber Q or Family Q barbecue, set up your barbecue with a convection tray, trivet, and smoker boxes. If using a premium gas barbecue, set up your barbecue with a universal smoker box. 

    * To prepare the trout, make several crossways incisions into the flesh on both sides of each trout. Finely chop half of the dill and half of the parsley, reserve the remaining for the cavity. Finely chop the capers and garlic, combine with the herbs into a bowl. Add the olive oil, the juiced lemon, and season with salt and pepper. 

    * Spread the herb mix over both sides of each trout. Stuff the cavities with the reserved parsley, dill, and lemon slices. 

    * Drain and add the wood chips to the charcoal or to the smoker box of a gas barbecue, following the manufacturer’s instructions. When smoke appears, add both fish to the barbecue and roast over **_indirect medium heat_** for 30 to 35 minutes, or until just cooked through.

    * Garnish with the micro herbs and serve.
