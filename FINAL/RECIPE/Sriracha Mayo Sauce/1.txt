We like the fruity heat of Sriracha, but if you have a different favorite hot
sauce, go right ahead. Use this mayonnaise for our Ultimate BLT.

1

garlic clove, finely grated

1

cup mayonnaise

3

tablespoons Sriracha

2

tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Kosher salt

## Preparation

### Step 1

Stir garlic, mayonnaise, Sriracha, and lemon juice in a small bowl to combine;
season with salt.

### Step 2

 **Do Ahead:** Mayonnaise can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
