15 Tasty Snack Ideas for People With Diabetes

####  15 Tasty Snack Ideas for People With Diabetes

When you're managing diabetes, snacks play a key role in keeping your blood
sugar stable. A pantry stash of pre-packaged, carb-loaded snacks full of added
sugar and sodium won't cut it, though. You're much better off noshing on whole
foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains. The
following diabetes-friendly snacks spin nutritious ingredients into delicious,
deceptively healthy snacks. Recipes like plantain chips, peanut butter balls,
roasted chickpeas, and guacamole compete with processed snacks in flavor, and
leave you feeling full.

3.23.19 I think anytime you start dealing with spiciness, personal taste
always kicks in, so you adapt. We’re about upper middle on heat, and we found
to suit our taste, this needed a LOT more sriracha. That little bit of lemon
juice really brightens the flavor, and this was delicious on a Friday night
pork tenderloin sandwich. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
