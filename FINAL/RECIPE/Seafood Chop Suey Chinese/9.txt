that are inspired by foods from all over the world._

How to make chop suey, a Chinese-inspired dish.

Dred Cuan

Chop suey is a famous Chinese dish that is typically made with meat and
vegetables. Variations of this dish are offered in different regions. Some add
quail eggs, while others use seafood (such shrimp and squid) as an alternative
to meat.

I like to make chop suey using chicken skin. It's affordable, easy to prepare
and delicious!

## Instructions

  1. Season chicken skin with salt and pepper.
  2. Heat oil in a frying pan.
  3. Fry chicken skin until golden brown. Set aside.
  4. Heat oil in a sauteing pan.
  5. Saute onion and garlic.
  6. Add 4 cups of water, oyster sauce, and fish sauce. Bring to a boil.
  7. Once boiling, add chayote. Cook until slightly tender.
  8. Immediately add carrots, green beans, and bell pepper.
  9. Dilute cornstarch into the remaining cup of water. Pour into the pan. Bring it to a boil again.
  10. Add the cooked chicken skin. Season with salt and pepper.
  11. Turn off the heat. Stir in the cabbage. Let the remaining heat cook it for at least 1 minute.

## Tips and Techniques

  * Try using other types of meat, such as beef, pork, or chicken.
  * Make a seafood variation of this recipe by adding shrimp, squid, crab or any type of fish.
  * Add boiled quail egg to make it fancier.
  * Include other vegetables, such as potato, sweet peas, young corn, etc.
  * Allow the sauce to boil before adding the vegetables in order to lessen the cooking time.
  * Turning off the heat before adding the cabbage will keep it from overcooking. Cover the pot and allow the steam to cook it.
