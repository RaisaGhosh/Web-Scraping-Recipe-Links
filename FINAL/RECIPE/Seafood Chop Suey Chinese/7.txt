## History of Chop suey

Chop suey is not the only Chinese-American dish that bears little resemblance
to Chinese cooking. It is, however, exceptional in terms of its popularity and
the extent to which it was known in the late 1800s, decades after the first
wave of Chinese immigration to America during and around the Gold Rush period.

According to some historians, this cuisine was initially a noodle-based dish
similar to Chow Mein.  
To make chop suey, you can use many varieties of vegetables, meat, seafood,
and other additions as you like.

## Chop Suey vs Chow Mein

Both chop suey and chow mein are Chinese stir fry dishes. But they are
different in ingredients, preparation, and origin. Chow mein includes adding
cooked noodles to the cooking sauces, vegetables, and meat. Chop suey is the
mixture of cooked vegetables and meat along with the sauces is served over
already cooked rice or fried noodles.

## Ingredients of Chop Suey

  * **Vegetables**
    * You can use leftover vegetables from your fridge that need to be cooked soon, or you can gather fresh vegetables from your own garden to prepare the chop suey. The vegetables like cabbage, carrots, onions, celery, bell pepper, cauliflower, broccoli, garlic, young corn, mushrooms, beans, bamboo shoots, and bean sprouts are used for this recipe.

  * **Meat**
    * Many variants of meat are used to prepare the chop suey. Pork, chicken, beef are the most common and favorable ones. The Philippines are used pork or chicken liver, chicken heart, and gizzard for the chop suey.

  * **Seafood**
    * There are several varieties of seafood like shrimps, prawns, scallops, squid, and mussels are added for the chop suey.

  * **Other additions**
    * Hard-boiled quail eggs and fried firm tofu are also popular additions for chop suey.

When cook vegetables, do not overcook them. Use vibrant and tender-crisp
vegetables to prepare this recipe. Make sure to not use the soggy and gray
vegetables. Vegetables should be parboiled and then blanch them. This helps to
preserve the vibrancy, flavor, and nutrients of the vegetables. When you
choose a wok or skillet, should be considered about the size of the wok. It is
big enough to accommodate all the ingredients.

When preparing chop suey make sure not to use canned quail eggs. Boiled fresh
quail eggs are most peferable and they taste good and more natural. Baby corn
or young corn are added to make the dish look and taste better. Red and green
bell peppers are added to make the dish vibrant and enticing.
