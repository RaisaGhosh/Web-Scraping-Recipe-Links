# Crispy Golden Purse Wontons



“Tung Tong” is a golden crispy fried wonton. Resembling a money bag. These are
delicate little deep-fried wontons that are sure to please any crowd. You can
have these baked or deep friend. But deep-fried wontons are my personal
preference. The wonton wrappers make them crispy and beautiful.



## Ingredients

### WONTON:

  * 1 pack wonton

  * 24 blanched green onion stem

### MEAT FILLING INGREDIENTS:

  * 1 lb ground meat of choice

  * 6 - 8 mushrooms

  * 2 green onion

  * 1 tbsp premium soy sauce

  * 1 tbsp oyster sauce

  * 1 tsp honey or agave

  * 1 tsp fish sauce



## Instructions

Prep your filling by mincing your mushrooms and adding in the seasonings
(premium soy sauce, oyster sauce, honey and fish sauce). Prep your green onion
ribbons by splitting the stem into 2 - 4 strips.

In a pot, fill with water and bring to a boil. In a separate bowl prepare an
ice bath. Add your green onion ribbons to the boiling water to blanch (~10-15
sec) and proceed to shock in cold water.

Add 1 tsp of filling to wonton wrapper. Bunch like a golden pouch then tie
with green onion ribbon.

Fry your golden bags, dip in sauce of choice, serve, Enjoy!
