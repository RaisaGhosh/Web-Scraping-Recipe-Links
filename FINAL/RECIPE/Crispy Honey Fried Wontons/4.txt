Myriad colourful veggies, sautéed till crisp and tossed with noodles and
sauce, make a wonderful filling for wontons. The success of this stuffing, and
most stir-fried veggies for that matter, depends on heating the kadai
properly. You need to make it smoke, literally, before adding the veggies, so
that the bright colours and crunchiness of the veggies are retained. Stuff the
wonton wrappers, seal them and deep-fry till perfectly golden in colour. Serve
the Fried Wontons with Schezuan sauce to enjoy a rainy evening the Chinese
way!
