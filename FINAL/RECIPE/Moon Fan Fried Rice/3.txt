Food Recipe

## Ingredients

1.5 kg fresh chicken  
4 x 180ml cups of basmati rice  
150 grams dried Chinese  
Shiitake mushrooms  
225 grams canned bamboo shoots (or well soaked dried shrimps)  
4 Chinese sausages  
1 medium onion  
5 spring onions  
500 ml beef stock  
3 tablespoons dark  
soy sauce  
3 tablespoons fish sauce  
1 teaspoon sesame oil  
5 tablespoons  
vegetable oil or as required  
1 tablespoon finely crushed garlic  
1 tablespoon finely crushed ginger  
water as required  
salt and pepper to taste

## Method

Soak dried Chinese Shiitake mushrooms in hot water for at least 2-3 hours to
allow the dried mushrooms to plump up. Put dried mushrooms in bowl filled with
hot water. Put a saucer upright on top to keep the dried mushrooms immersed.
Similarly, if you are using dried shrimps soak in hot water for at least 3-4
hours or until hydrated and plump.

Remove skin and fatty bits from chicken. Debone chicken and cut into bite size
pieces (2 cm). Season with 3 tablespoons of dark soy sauce, salt and pepper to
taste. Mix well, cover and allow sauce to blend in with chicken for at least
30 minutes. Stir gently at regular intervals.

Wash rice in cold water until it runs clear. Cook the 4 x 180 ml cups of rice,
using 500 ml of beef stock and 550 ml of water, preferably in a rice cooker.
Check at intervals and switch off rice cooker when rice is still very moist
but not fully cooked. Keep covered. Water quantity could vary depending upon
the basmati rice variety.

Finely chop onion, bamboo shoots (if used) and spring onions and put aside in
separate containers.  
Remove the soaked dried mushrooms from the bowl and gently squeeze out the
water. Slice into 2 cm long by 1 cm wide strips. Put aside. If you are using
dried shrimps, drain carefully removing impurities and put aside.

Heat up wok or similar deep frying pan over medium to high heat. When wok is
ready pour in 5 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Allow oil to sizzle. Fry the
chicken pieces in 2 -3 batches until golden brown. Move around carefully to
ensure even frying and that you don't break up the chicken pieces. Remove and
put aside on kitchen paper or grill to soak away the excess oil.

If there is not enough oil in the wok, add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil or
as required. Heat up over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onions, finely
crushed garlic and ginger. Stir fry until the onion pieces become transparent.
Add the sliced bamboo shoots or drained soaked dried shrimps, soaked dried
mushroom strips and stir fry with the onions, garlic and ginger mixture until
cooked. Stir carefully using a flat wok spatula from the bottom at intervals
to avoid burning the ingredients. Make sure that the mushroom strips are
cooked and tender to the bite.

Add the fried chicken pieces to the other ingredients in the wok. Add the fish
sauce. Stir mix together carefully without breaking nor crushing the
ingredients. Remove from heat and put aside.

Remove the not fully cooked rice from the rice cooker and put in large
container, leaving a small layer of rice at the bottom of rice cooker.
Carefully place a layer of the chicken, bamboo shoots or cooked dried shrimps,
onion and mushroom mix into the rice cooker. Use one third of the mix. Layer
evenly. Add one third of the rice from the large container on top of the
chicken, bamboo shoots or cooked dried shrimps, onion and mushroom mix.

Repeat with another third of the rice followed by another third of the
chicken, bamboo shoots or cooked dried shrimps, onion and mushroom mix. Place
the remaining third of the rice on top and spread evenly. Add another 2 x 180
ml cups of water into the rice cooker. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of sesame oil.
Close rice cooker and switch on. Allow to cook. Check rice when cooked to
ensure that it is cooked to your preference. You may adjust water quantity to
suit your taste.

If you do not have a rice cooker, you can also cook the rice in a large thick
bottom casserole saucepan over moderate heat. Cover whilst cooking to retain
the moisture with the rice.

Whilst the rice is cooking, finely slice the spring onions. Finely angle slice
the Chinese sausages and place in a glass container. Cover with kitchen paper
and cook the Chinese sausages in the microwave in 15 seconds instalments until
just cooked and looking really appetising.

Serve the rice from the rice cooker by gently penetrating the layers and
dishing out the various ingredients and rice proportionally. Decorate with the
finely chopped spring onions and some slices of the Chinese sausages.  
Ideally served with a ripe tomato chutney with chopped chillies, onion slices
and chopped coriander leaves.

Enjoy.
