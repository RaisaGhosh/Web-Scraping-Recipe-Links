# Chicken with Oyster Sauce Stir Fry

Jump to Recipe Print Recipe

Looking for an easy chicken dinner recipe? Chicken stir-fry sounds like a good
choice and it can be better if you prepare a tasty one â€“ just like this
Chicken with Oyster Sauce Stir fry. This is an easy and flavorful chicken stir
fry recipe that you can complete in less than 30 minutes; that means you have
more time to make fried rice or keep the extra time for yourself.

Chicken with Oyster Sauce Stir fry makes use of three main ingredients; the
first two are already given in the name of the dish â€“ the third is (or should
I say are) bell peppers. I am using 4 colors of bell peppers for this recipe
to make this dish look more appetizing. You can also limit yourself in using
just the green and red varieties.

The first part of the recipe is to marinate the chicken in oyster sauce and
other ingredients that will help infuse flavor; next is stir frying then you
are ready to enjoy your dish. There is really nothing like a quick, easy, and
delicious chicken dinner. I think that a glass of white wine will also be nice
if you want to relax more and better enjoy your meal.

Hey â€“ donâ€™t forget to see us next time for other recipes. It is our pleasure
to share all of them with you.

You can use shaoxing cooking wine or rice wine. You can also omit the wine if
you don't have it.
