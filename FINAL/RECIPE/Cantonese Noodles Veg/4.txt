limited flavor by just adding soya and vinegar. In order to modify to Indian
the plate, the recipe consists of extra ingredients such as chili sauce to
enhance the flavor.

It is preferable to add chicken strips or kinds of seafood like prawns.

## How to make Cantonese Style Vegetarian Chowmein Recipes

  1. We begin making the Cantonese Style Vegetarian Chow mien Recipe by boiling the noodles in a saucepan with enough water. Cook till it is half done. Then strain the water by using a strainer and run the noodles under cold water for 1 minute. Then toss it with a tablespoon of oil in order to stop the cooking.

  2. Pre - heat the “air fryer” at 180-degree celsius for 5 minutes.Once done place the noodles inside the basket and then in order to half crisp the noodle place it inside for 5 minutes. When it is done, remove the basket out and keep it aside.

  3. Heat a saucepan with oil add ginger, garlic and then add in all the vegetables, fry till the vegetable is all done. 

  4. The next step is to mix the cornstarch in a small bowl with all the sauces and other ingredients mentioned in the list by adding 1/2 cup of water. Reduce the heat and pour the entire mixture into the pan slowly and keep mixing slowly so that the sauce doesn't thicken.

  5. When the sauce is reached to a pouring consistency, you are now ready to pour it over the half crispy noodles and can be served hot. 

  6. Serve your Cantonese Style Vegetarian Chow Mein with Cantonese Style Ban Mien Bian Ruo (Noodle Soup With Vegetable dumplings)
