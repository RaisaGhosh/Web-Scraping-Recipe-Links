Vegetable Manchurian Gravy Recipe In Hindi (हिन्दी में पढ़े)

Vegetable Manchurian Gravy Recipe In Gujarati (ગુજરાતી માં વાંચો)

Ingredients:  
---  
For Veg Manchurian Balls  
1/3 cup Maida (all purpose flour)  
2 tablespoons Cornflour (corn starch)  
3/4 cup shredded Carrot (Gajar)  
3/4 cup shredded Cabbage  
1/2 cup finely chopped Capsicum  
1 finely chopped Green Chilli (Hari Mirch)  
1/2 teaspoon Pepper Powder  
1 pinch Ajinomoto (MSG), optional  
1 teaspoon + for deep frying Cooking Oil  
Salt  
For Gravy  
2 teaspoons crushed Ginger  
2 Green Chillies (Hari Mirch), slit and cut into halves  
1 tablespoon minced Garlic (Lasoon)  
2 tablespoons finely chopped Spring Onion  
1 tablespoon Cooking Oil  
2 tablespoons Soy Sauce  
1/2 tablespoon Chilli Sauce  
2 tablespoons Tomato Ketchup  
1 teaspoon Pepper Powder  
2 tablespoons Cornflour (corn starch)  
1 cup + 2 cups Water  
Salt  
  
Directions for Making Manchurian Balls:

  1. Take a bowl, add shredded carrot, shredded cabbage, chopped capsicum and chopped green chilli, 1 teaspoon oil, pepper powder, a pinch of ajinomoto (MSG), maida, cornflour and salt.

  2. Mix all ingredients properly. Prepare 10-12 small round shaped balls from the mix. Do not add water in the mix for making balls as water from vegetables will be sufficient to bind them. In case mix is not binding properly and small balls cannot be made, add some water in the mixture.

  3. Heat oil in a kadai (pan). Deep fry prepared balls on medium flame until they turn golden brown. Drain excess oil and transfer them to plate (spread kitchen paper napkin on plate to absorb excess oil).

Directions for Making Gravy for Vegetable Manchurian:

  1. Dissolve 2 tablespoons cornflour in a 1 cup normal water.

  2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan. Add minced ginger, minced garlic, chopped green chilli and chopped spring onion. Sauté for a minute. Add soy sauce, chilli sauce and tomato ketchup; sauté for a minute.

  3. Pour 2 cups water, pepper powder and salt. Bring mixture to boil over medium flame. When it starts boiling, let it boil for a minute.

  4. Add dissolved cornflour in a pan. Mix all gravy ingredients properly. Cook it on low flame for 1-2 minutes.

  5. Add deep fried balls and cook for 3 minutes over medium flame.

  6. Turn off flame and garnish it with chopped spring onion. Enjoy hot and spicy veg cabbage manchurian with Chinese fried rice or veg noodles.

Tips and Variations:

  * Do not add water in the vegetable mix while making balls as water from vegetables will be enough to bind them. In case mix does not bind properly and small balls cannot be made, add some water in the mixture.
  * Initially keep gravy thin and little watery otherwise it may become very thick when cooked completely.
  * Cook manchurian balls just before serving. Do not cook them in advance otherwise they will turn soggy.
  * This recipe uses Ajinomoto (MSG) to get an authentic Chinese taste. However, you can avoid it if its not available or you are not comfortable using it.

Taste: Delicious soft veg fried balls dipped in spicy flavorful gravy.

Serving Ideas: Serve it with hakka noodles for dinner or just savor hot and
spicy food on its own.

Can I prepare manchurian balls couple of hours before making gravy.  

 **Response:** Yes, you can prepare raw manchurian balls a couple of hours ago
and keep in the refrigerator. Fry them just before the serving.

Mast mind blowing recipe hai. Jarur banana. Mujee to ye recipe bahot kam aaee.  

Jun 07, 2017 by Yash Solanki

Why are my balls are crispy and the gravy is bitter in taste?  

 **Response:** Hello Yash, the reason behind crispy balls is the corn flour
and the reason behind bitter gravy is the soy sauce. Excess amount of soy
sauce makes the gravy bitter in taste, so be careful while measuring and
adding the soy sauce.

Mar 29, 2017 by Zahra

Hey, thanks for the recipe.  
I made this but my balls were so soggy but I did not add any water. So I added
more Maida but they became hard after words.  
I don't know what went wrong.  

 **Response:** Hello Zahra, the main reason behind the hard balls is the
excess amount of maida.  
Don't keep the shredded vegetables idle for long time as they release the
water as time goes.  
Make the mixture at the time of making balls. If you make it in advance,
vegetables will release the water and the mixture will turn watery.  
If the vegetables are releasing too much water, squeeze them a little bit
before mixing with the other ingredients (maida and cornflour).

Mar 26, 2017 by Rajni

Very tasty and very thankful to you....  

Feb 11, 2017 by Nimrat

Can u plz tell...  
If using corn starch is compulsory...or optional as I'm making it without corn
starch/flour.  

 **Response:** Yes Nimrat, corn starch is necessary to thicken the gravy.

Jan 01, 2017 by Garima

My sauce become very bitter in taste why please tell me.  

 **Response:** Hello Garmia, the main reason behind the bitter sauce is the
excess amount of soy sauce. When you try this next time, use mild sauce and
add leeser amount of it.

What should be the actual quantity of maida required to be mixed with 2
tablespoons of cornflour?  

 **Response:** Hello Nidhi, 1 cup maida = 120 gm. In this recipe 1/3 cup maida
is used and so, 1/3 cup maida = 40gm maida.

haven't disclosed what's the secret. I've tried lot of your recipes and they
have all turned out so delicious .  
  
Today I cooked Hakka Noodles and veg Manchurian for a party of 25 people.

Your fan

Can we use rice flour in place of corn flour?  
Or any other alternative to corn one?  

 **Response:** You cannot use

I have prepared manchurian ball but it got tuff, quantity was 600 gm maida,
500 gm cabbage and 2 tablespoons corn flour.  
  
Why are we using corn floor?  

 **Response:** Hi Dolly, you have added too much maida and that's why the
manchurian balls turn hard. Corn flour (cornstarch) is added to get crispy
outer layer.

Mar 22, 2015 by Anand Lakshmi Narasimhan

The recipe works perfectly. however I did not deep fry cauliflower for health
reasons. If I would have done it then recipe would be like restaurant style.  
Novice to cooking and bachelors can also try this dish. It's far simpler than
paneer dishes where we have to add right amount of salt and spices at the
right time in right ratio to get the taste. It takes lot of experiments to
learn paneer dishes but here we use sauces bought from store to get taste. Far
simpler.  

Feb 23, 2015 by Raji

Very nice recipe, my hubby & family liked very much. It's very tasty.

Your site recipes are so simple I tried many of them and my family love
it..thanks to you..  

Sep 01, 2014 by tulipz

Thank you for your response to my earlier comment. I am perhaps going wrong
with chilli sauce. Which brand do you use? I used Maggi chilli sauce - the red
one -is that okay for this recipe?  

 **Response:** Hi Tulipz, I used "Ching's secret" brand chilli sauce and soy
sauce in this recipe and all other Chinese recipes on this website. You can
use any brand's chilli sauce but it should have chilli and vinegar as base
ingredients. Do not use tomato chilli sauce.

Aug 31, 2014 by vinayak shirke

I love your site and your dishes very much.  

Aug 20, 2014 by Tulipz

I tried it today. One of the best manchurians **I made***. My earlier trials
were awful !  
With this recipe, manchurian balls were perfect but the gravy didnt taste like
the restaurant types. Is it because I skipped MSG? However, my 6yr old licked
her plate up. So its definitely tasty :)  
  
I like your site. Thank you!  

 **Response:** Hi Tulipz, thanks for trying the recipe. MSG is not used in
gravy so if you do not add it, taste of gravy will not change.  
The taste of the gravy depends on the sauces you have used in the recipe. Use
the tomato ketchup which tastes mild sweet and do not change the quantity of
any other sauce. Add more tomato ketchup or tomato sauce to get mild sweet
taste and add more chili sauce to make it spicy.

Its very tasty and yummy

MSG is bad, and it can cause complications that can lead upto nasty diseases
like cancer.  
  
Of course, I'll skip the MSG while preparing my manchurian, but I think it may
be greatly beneficial if websites like this stop mentioning MSG in recipes.  
  
Just a thought.  
  
Thanks,  
Rajesh.  

 **Response:** We agree with your suggestion and that is the reason why we
have mentioned the MSG as an optional ingredient in ingredients table list and
in the tips section as well.
