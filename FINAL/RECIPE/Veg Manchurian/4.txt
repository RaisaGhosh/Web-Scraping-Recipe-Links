### How to make Vegetable Manchurian

  * #### Step 1 Clean the veggies

Soak the veggies in lukewarm water with a pinch of salt, this will wash off
all the adulterants from the vegetables.

  * ##### Step 2 Make Manchurian mixture

Once the vegetables are washed, take a chopping board and finely chop the
vegetables. Take a large bowl and squeeze out the excess water from cabbage
and carrots. Now, take another bowl and mix paneer, cabbage, carrot,
cauliflower, 1 tsp green chilli, ginger-garlic paste, 1 tsp coriander leaves,
green beans, dark soy sauce, salt to taste, white pepper powder and 2 tsp
light soy sauce. Mix all the ingredients well. Then, add all-purpose flour and
corn starch and knead a soft dough or mixture to make Manchurian balls.

  * ###### Step 3 Prepare the Manchurian balls

Take some mixture from the bowl and shape it into a bite-sized ball. Repeat to
make more such balls. Then, heat 1 cup of vegetable oil on medium flame and
heat the oil. When the oil is hot enough, deep fry the Manchurian balls till
they turn golden brown and keep them aside.

  * ###### Step 4 Prepare the Manchurian gravy

Now, put another pan over medium flame and heat oil in it. When the oil is hot
enough, add 1 tbsp garlic in it along with ½ tsp green chilli and saute for a
few seconds. Then, add onion, 1 tbsp mixed bell peppers, 1 tbsp coriander
leaves. Cook for a minute and then add tomato ketchup, chilli sauce and cook
for another minute. Now, add white vinegar, water and broth powder to the pan
and stir well. Cook for another minute.

  * ###### Step 5 Add Manchurian balls

Finally, add ½ tsp dark soy sauce and the fried Manchurian balls in it. Stir
well.

  * ###### Step 6 Serve hot

Sprinkle some coriander leaves and serve hot with fried rice, steamed rice or
Hakka noodles. Do try this recipe, rate it and let us know how it turned out
to be.

##### Tips

  1. While making the Manchurian balls, you can add corn flour if you find it difficult to bind the stuffing together to make small manchurian balls. 
  2. Just refrigerate the manchurian balls for few hours before frying.
  3. You can also use homemade veggie broth instead of broth powder.
