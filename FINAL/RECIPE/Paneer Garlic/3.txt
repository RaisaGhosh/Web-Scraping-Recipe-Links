**Garlic paneer recipe** - delicious garlic flavored quick paneer starter that
can be made under 15 minutes. This can be served in so many wonderful ways -
as a starter for parties, as a evening snack or can be used as a filling for
kathi rolls.

* * *

Since it is mildly spicy and hot, it is best to enjoy during the chilly
winters. The spice levels can be adjusted to suit kids' taste buds. This
recipe is adapted from our family favorite **garlic chicken recipe**.

You can serve this alongside **fried rice** or **hakka noodles**.

There is no deep frying involved to make this garlic paneer recipe. The sauce
used is homemade with just minimum ingredients.

This also goes well in lunch box as a side. If you prefer to make paneer at
home, you can check this post on **Homemade Paneer**.

6\. Saute on a medium flame until the mixture begins to leave the sides of the
pan or oil begins to separate. There is not much oil used but still one can
make out when the sauce is ready. It turns fragrant. But do not overcook,
garlic may turn bitter.

7\. Add paneer and toss gently to coat the mixture.

8\. Saute for just 2 to 3 minutes. Do not overcook. Pour that to the pan and
cook until thickens. It just takes one to 2 minutes to thicken.

Garnish with coriander leaves or celery.

Liz, You will find them in Indian or Asian stores. Use low heat red chilli
powder or chilli flakes if you can't find chilies

This was the first time I tried Paneer, and it was delicious. I made a smaller
quantity since I was just cooking for myself. I also forgot to add the water,
but it turned out alright. Thanks for the recipe!

Hi Swasthi,

Firstly, wish you a happy and healthy new year 2021.

I just happened to stumbled upon this recipe.. it seems so interesting..I will
definitely try it.

However, I do not have vinegar. Can I replace the vinegar in this recipe with
lemon juice or any other alternate ? If yes, how much quantity will be needed?

Thank you!
