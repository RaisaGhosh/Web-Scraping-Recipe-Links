A sauce that combines spices like pepper with garlic can be nothing but
exciting! In this yummy preparation, succulent cottage cheese is grilled with
a sprinkling of salt and herbs, and then drowned in a tongue-tickling pepper-
garlic sauce.  
  
The crisp and soft texture of the paneer together with the peppy flavour of
the sauce makes the Grilled Paneer with Spicy Pepper Garlic Sauce an amazing
preparation, which can be served as a starter or used as part of sizzlers .  
  
The sauce tends to thicken over time, so do not make it too much in advance—if
you do, make sure you adjust the consistency with a little water before
pouring it over the paneer. The paneer too needs to be grilled just in time,
because it can get chewy after a while.  
  
Also have a go at other paneer recipes like the Paneer Parcels or Paneer
Potato Rosti .

It was only after I followed the recipe that I discovered in the comments here
that water needed to be added to the sauce. Thankfully, I had already added
sufficient water to get the sauce right. It''s a quick, easy and tasty recipe
but please make the correction so less experienced cooks don''t make a mistake
and miss out enjoying the recipe as much as I did.

The sauce in the recipe looks quite liquidy. Do we need to add water while
cooking it? 2tbsp of ketchup will not make it so liquidy. Please advise.  
Edited after original posting.
