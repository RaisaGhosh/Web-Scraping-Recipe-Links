## How to make Sweet And Sour Vegetables Recipe

  1. To begin making the Sweet and Sour Vegetables recipes, do make sure you have all the ingredients ready and the vegetables cut in the desired shapes and sizes

 **Method to make the sauce**

  1. Combine all the ingredients in the sauce by adding 1/2 cup of water. Whisk well. Place the ingredients in a sauce pan and bring the mixture to a boil stirring continuously to lumps don’t form. Once the sauce thickens, adjust the thickness of the sauce by adding more or less water. Check the salt and spice levels and add more of the sauces if needed. Keep this sauce aside, while we proceed to prepare the vegetables.

  2. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a wok over a high flame and add the onions, garlic and capsicum and sauté on a medium flame for 1 to 2 minutes.

  3. Stir in the remaining vegetables, sprinkle some salt and stir fry until the vegetables are cooked and slightly tender. You can optionally cover the wok and cook on medium heat. This creates a steam that helps the vegetables in the wok to cook faster.

  4. Once the vegetables are done, add in the prepared sauce and bring the mixture to a boil. Once the vegetables get well coated with the sauce, do a taste check. Adjust salt and spice levels to suit your taste.

  5. Serve Sweet And Sour Vegetables Recipe along with Vegetarian Hakka Noodles (Chinese Chow mein Recipe) or Chilli Coriander Fried Rice Recipe for a Friday meal.
