Need an easy and nutritious stir fry recipe? This healthy **Sweet & Sour
Vegetable Stir Fry** is loaded with colorful veggies tossed in a simple sweet
and tangy sauce. It's a delicious gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegetarian main
or side dish that only takes 20 minutes to make.

Stir fry recipes are a very fast and easy way to get a filling and nutritious
meal on the table. This **Sweet & Sour Vegetable Stir Fry** is a great
vegetarian option to add to your dinner table or can be made as a side dish to
go alongside an Asian meal. We also love that this healthy vegetable stir fry
is low in carbs, gluten-free, dairy-free, and full of fiber and nutrients.

You can serve this stir fry on it's own, or make white rice on the stove or
our Chicken Fried Rice to serve with it.

## why you'll love this recipe

  * **Versatile.** This stir fry can be served as a main dish or a side dish. You can easily substitute other veggies based on what's in season. Or add cooked chicken or tofu for extra protein. 
  * **Healthy sauce.** Most stir fry sauces are filled with added sugars and fats. This sauce is sweetened with apple juice and honey instead, which makes it more natural and lower in sugar. 
  * **Fast and easy.** The whole dish comes together in just about 20 minutes. It's perfect for those busy night dinners.

## How to make This healthy vegetable stir fry

  * **Start sauce.** Combine apple cider vinegar, juice, tomato sauce, soy sauce, and salt in a small saucepan. Cook the sauce over low heat until it starts to bubble.
  *  **Thicken and finish the** sauce. Meanwhile, whisk corn flour and 2 tablespoons of water. Stir the cornflour mixture into the sauce and whisk, stirring vigorously for a couple of minutes until thickened. Let the sauce cool at room temperature for a few minutes. Then stir in honey, mix well, and set aside.

  * **Prepare veggies.** Slice the green onions and cut mushrooms into halves. Peel and slice the carrot diagonally. Cut the peppers into strips.

  *   * 

  * **Sauté aromatics.** Next heat oil in a wok or a skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant.
  *  **Cook veggies.** Add carrots, bell peppers, and broccoli florets. Cook, stirring constantly until veggies are slightly golden brown, 3-4 minutes. Then stir in the mushrooms and green onions and continue to stir fry for 2-3 minutes more.

  * **Finish dish.** Pour in the prepared sweet and sour sauce and bring to a boil, then toss to coat the veggies while still on the heat. Remove from heat and serve hot. Enjoy!

## FAq's and tips

  * **Cremini mushrooms:** These are also called baby Bella mushrooms. They can be substituted with white mushrooms if needed. 
  * **Apple juice:** Choose 100% juice with limited added sugar. 
  * **Cornflour:** This is a gluten-free flour, but you can substitute regular flour if you don't have a gluten preference. 
  * **Honey:** Honey is used instead of sugar to sweeten the sauce. Agave nectar would also work well. 
  * Make sure to cut all the vegetables before starting. Stir fry goes fast, so you want to be ready for each step when it comes. 
  * Cut the vegetables in similar sized pieces to help them cook evenly. 
  * Keep the sauce on low heat and stir constantly to avoid burning it.

## Can I use other vegetables?

Yes! You can use practically any vegetables that are in season or that you
have on hand. Try zucchini, yellow squash, asparagus, green beans, snap or
snow peas, bok choy, celery, or bean sprouts.

## How do i store this recipe?

Store your Sweet & Sour Vegetable Stir Fry in an air-tight container in the
fridge for 3-4 days. Then gently reheat it in the microwave before serving
again.

## Can I freeze vegetable stir fry?

You can't freeze this stir fry after it has been cooked. But you can make the
sauce and freeze it ready to go for up to three months in advance. Then thaw
it, heat it on the stove, and toss it over freshly cooked veggies.
