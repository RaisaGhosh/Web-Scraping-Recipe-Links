## About This Recipe

Whenever I have some sudden guests at home for dinner or even when my sonâ€™s
friends come over to my place, the first cuisine that comes to my mind is Indo
Chinese.

Why? Because it is easy to make, quick and most importantly itâ€™s delicious and
loved by almost everyone.

So when it comes to vegetarian options, I often go for this incredibly easy
and tasty Sweet and Sour Vegetables, that is loved every time I make it.

Delicious to eat and quick to make, this is a combination of a variety of
vegetables cooked in Asian sauces and spices. If we talk about the taste
palate, sweet and sour in one dish makes it a bomb combination.

So, go ahead and make this quick and scrumptious recipe for your friends and
family and surprise them with your culinary skills.

This recipe is vegan, gluten-free and an Indo-Chinese preparation with all the
Asian flavors that will just burst into your mouth once you take a bite.

This Sweet and Sour Vegetable is,

  * Vegan 
  * Delicious
  * Quick
  * Easy & Quick
  * Loaded with vegetables

## Ingredients

**Vegetables** â€“ It is a Chinese style dish that is filled with the goodness
of a variety of vegetables such as red capsicum, yellow capsicum, green
capsicum, mushroom, carrot, and green onions. You can also add vegetables of
your own choice to make this dish.

**Tofu** â€“ For protein, I have also added Tofu that adds a soft texture to
this dish. But you can also substitute Tofu with Paneer.

If you are a Non-Vegetarian, then you can add Chicken in place of Tofu or
Paneer and make a Sweet and Sour Chicken with the vegetable recipe.

**Oil** â€“ I have used a combination of vegetable oil and sesame oil to make
this dish, as sesame oil adds a nice flavor. But you can even use only
vegetable oil to make this Sweet and Sour vegetable.

**Sauce** â€“ We will use two basic sauces â€“ soy sauce and red chili sauce.
These two sauces combined will add a nice savory spicy taste in the dish.

**Red Chilli Paste** â€“ To make it nice and spicy, we will also add in red
chili paste. You can adjust the amount of this paste as per your spice level.

**Sugar** â€“ To add that sweetness along with spicy flavor add in brown sugar,
which also adds to the color of this recipe.

**Vinegar** â€“ It adds a subtle tangy, that makes the dish even more delicious.
You can also use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.

**Corn Flour** â€“ Corn Flour is mixed with a little water and then added to the
gravy, which thickens the sauce a bit. If you do not want the thick
consistency, you can avoid adding it.

**Others** â€“ Apart from the above-mentioned ingredients, we will need ginger,
garlic, lemon juice, MSG, salt, and white pepper powder.

MSG is optional, you can completely avoid adding it.

## Step By Step Recipe

Heat vegetable oil and sesame oil in a wok.

When the oil is very hot, add ginger and garlic and fry for a few seconds.

Add the chopped vegetables and saute for a few minutes on high heat.

Add tofu and cook for a minute. Then add 2 cups of water in the wok.

Add soy sauce, red chili sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, brown sugar, red chili
paste, MSG, salt, and white pepper powder and let the mixture come to a boil.

Mix cornflour with a little water and add it in the wok.

Cook till the sauce thickens. Garnish with spring onion greens. Serve hot.

## Storage Suggestions

Sweet Sour Vegetables will last for about 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator.
Make sure you store it in an airtight container.

Before serving, reheat it in a pan or microwave until nice and warm. If you
feel it has become a little thick, add in a little water while reheating.

## Serving Suggestions

You can serve this curry along with Mushroom Fried Rice, Vegetable Fried Rice,
Schezwan Fried Rice, Instant Pot Jasmine Rice or Thai Pineapple Fried Rice.

It even tastes great along with noodles such as Schezwan Noodles, Garlic
Noodles, Peanut Sesame Noodles, Chicken Hakka Noodles, or Chicken Sriracha
Noodles.

If you are looking for a nonvegetarian option, then you can serve this Sweet
and Sour Tofu with vegetables along with Chinese Egg Fried Rice, Chicken Fried
Rice, Shrimp Quinoa Fried Rice, Bacon Fried Rice, or Indo Chinese Schezwan Egg
Fried Rice.

So what are you waiting for, make this simple meal for your weeknight dinners
and let me know how you liked it?
