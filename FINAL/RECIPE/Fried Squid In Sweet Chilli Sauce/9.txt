## Fried Squid with Sweet Soy Sauce

Pour in a small quantity of wheat flour into a frying pan during a frying
process to prevent oil blast. You can also use another method. Just cover the
wok or frying pan but open the cover occasionally and stirr the squid to
prevent burning. Turn it over to fry the other side until both sides are
golden brown. If preferred, you can also take fish instead of squid.

### Instructions

  * Grind the ingredients for the marinade in a mortar into a smooth paste.

  * Or just mix the ingredients for the marinade together if you use powder ones.

  * Rub around the squid with marinating paste, put aside for 15 minutes.

  * Heat 50 ml oil in a frying pan, fry the squid until golden brown. Set aside to drain.

  * Heat 2 tbsp oil in another pan, stir fry the shallots, garlic, chilli and ginger. Stirring all the time until fragrant.

  * Add kecap manis, oyster sauce and kaffir lime leaves. Add pepper to taste. Stir to mix.

  * Then add the squid and continue to stirr and mix for a while until the spice is absorbed.

  * Turn off the heat, add the lime juice. Stir to mix. Serve hot with rice.
