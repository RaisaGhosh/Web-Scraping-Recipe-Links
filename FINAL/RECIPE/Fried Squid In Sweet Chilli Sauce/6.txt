##  Delicious Sweet & Spicy Squid Rings

12/11/2021

Squids are tender, juicy and scrumptious when cooked perfectly. This is an
easy dish to prepare with cleaning the squids and deep frying the rings taking
some time. Finally, tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce. Delicious and makes for
a great starter accompanied with an alcoholic drink. We enjoyed them with our
homemade ginger wine.  
  
A good source of protein, squids are also low in fat. Rich in vitamin and
mineral content. Ideal for individuals suffering from rheumatoid arthritis who
have low selenium levels in their blood. Squids have an abundance of this
mineral. It contains large amounts of phosphorus necessary for stimulating
calcium required for the building of bones and teeth.

Delicious Sweet & Spicy Squid Rings  
(Serves 4)  
  
Ingredients:  
6 large squids  
1/4 cup all-purpose flour  
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder  
1/4 teaspoon white pepper powder  
oil for deep frying  
salt  
  
Method:  
Clean squids separating the body from the tentacles. Discard the ink bag along
with the eye, keeping the tentacles. Clean the pocket inside out ensuring to
remove the outer surface of the mantle, internal organs and cartilage.  
  
Cut the squids into rings. Reserve the tentacles, flaps and tube ends for a
different dish.  
  
Wash the rings, season with salt and set aside to drain well using a colander
placed over a bowl for 30 minutes.  
  
In a bowl, mix the flour, garlic powder and pepper powder. Toss the rings in
the flour mixture to coat well.  
  
Heat oil on medium-high flame.  
  
Deep fry for a couple of minutes 8 to 10 rings at a time after shaking off
excess flour. Drain in a sieve set over a bowl.  
  
Continue frying the remaining squid rings as above.  
  
Sauce  
Ingredients:  
1/4 cup chilli garlic sauce (Huy Fong Foods Inc.)  
1/4 cup tomato ketchup  
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce  
1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup water for slurry  
2 tablespoons oil  
  
Method:  
In a skillet, heat oil and add the above three sauces. Stir until well
combined. Then, mix in slurry to thicken sauce. Finally, toss in the fried
squid rings ensuring to coat them with sauce.
