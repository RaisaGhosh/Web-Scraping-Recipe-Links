# Garlic Fish Curry

March 28, 2014

12 Comments

Jump to Recipe

This garlic fish curry couldnâ€™t be easier to make - itâ€™s simple, spicy, and of
course, garlicky.

Roby and I are observing Lent this month, and so seafood has been on the menu
a lot lately. While weâ€™d be happy eating this shrimp curry every week, I
figured it was time for something new. If youâ€™re a big fan of garlic, youâ€™re
going to love this dish.

While visiting a friend's house this past weekend, I spent a lot of time
talking to her parents about food (typical me. I am that friend). Her dad told
me how to prepare this simple garlic fish curry â€“ and Iâ€™m so happy that I
tried it! Itâ€™s effortless and tasty â€“ a perfect combination.

This fish curry is made with plenty of garlic, organic diced tomatoes, serrano
pepper, and a handful of fresh curry leaves (no, you canâ€™t replace this with
curry powder - theyâ€™re two totally different things). There's clearly a lot of
garlic in this recipe and so, if you donâ€™t have a garlic press yet, get oneâ€¦
itâ€™s a huge time saver.

The great thing about this dish is that you can whip it up for a last-minute
meal. If possible though, I suggest trying to make this a day in advance. Fish
curry always tastes better the next day â€“ once the flavors have had time to
marry. Either way â€“ itâ€™s going to taste great!

Great recipe - so quick and with simple, common ingredients! I found it needed
to be a bit more tangy once it was done, so perhaps some lemon juice at the
end? I cheated and seasoned with celery salt, and it worked quite well to
increase tang!

We made this with Vital Choice Fresh Mussels! We were planning to make Suppa
di Cozze but were out of some things. Never out of ingredients for your
recipes!

i love this recipe. i use coconut oil instead of avocado oil. does the oil
make a difference in taste?

Glad you like it! It may make a slight difference but probably not much.

This is absolutely easy and delicious!!!! I only had 6 cloves of garlic (and a
mystery red chili in my freezer-tres chaud even after being seeded!) but it
was still very good.
