# About Thai Basil Shrimp Stir Fry Recipe:

This basil shrimp is simple to make and will please anyone who is partial to
thai flavors. The dish comes together quickly and easily in the wok, and the
stir-frying method keeps both the juiciness of the shrimp as well as the
sweetness of the peppers in the dish, not to mention all of those wonderful
nutrients There are two key ingredients to this dish that make it sing, so be
sure to have them on hand: golden mountain sauce, which is a thai sauce that
can be purchased at most asian food stores (you'll find it next to the fish
sauce), and fresh basil. If you can find thai basil, great-if not, regular
sweet basil works well too.
