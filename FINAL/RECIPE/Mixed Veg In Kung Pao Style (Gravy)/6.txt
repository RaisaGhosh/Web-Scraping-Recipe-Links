Kung Pao Tofu is a traditional chinese dish that is stir fry made into a spicy
sauce combined with peanuts, vegetables, tofu and chilli peppers. Although the
dish is found throughout China, I believe there are regional variations of
this dish that is typically less spicy than the Sichuan. The combination of
stir fried vegetables along with the nutrition and protein packed Tofu makes
this dish wholesome and delicious when served along with brown rice.

Serve Kung Pao Tofu With Vegetables Recipe with brown rice or Sticky Rice
Recipe along with Cherry Tomato and Orange Salad Recipe and Toffee Banana
Recipe for a complete weekend meal with family and friends.
