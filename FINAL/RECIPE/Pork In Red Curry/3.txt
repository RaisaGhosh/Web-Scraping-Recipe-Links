JUMP TO RECIPE

  

We were having one of those crazy busy days and I needed to get dinner on the
table fast. This Thai Red Curry did the trick and I was able to prepare it in
less than 30 minutes. Thai cuisine is one of my favorites. I have tried to
cook Thai food at home for years, but it just didn't compare to the dishes I
loved at my favorite restaurants. Finally, I tried to make Thai curry pastes
from scratch, with authentic Thai recipes and these were much better;
terrific, in fact. However, making the curry pastes was an all-day affair
requiring too much work and too many special ingredients.

After a lot of trial and error, I was finally able to come up with some great
recipes that are quick, easy and delicious. Looking back on it, I realize that
I made a few mistakes in my earlier attempts at cooking Thai curries. Firstly,
I was thinning the coconut milk with broth or using lite coconut milk, in
order to avoid fat. Secondly, I was using the wrong brand of Thai curry paste
and finally, I was serving the curries with Basmati rice or long grain white
rice instead of Jasmine rice.

These days, we still love to go out for Thai because my kids like some noodle
dishes that I havenâ€™t tried to make at home (like Pad See Ew or Pad Kee Mow)
but more often than not, we eat Thai dishes right in our home and theyâ€™re
delicious! And the best part is that they can be made in no time at all. If
you like your curries on the sweet side, add an extra teaspoon of sugar. And
youâ€™ll just have to trust me on this â€“ use Maesri brand curry paste because it
makes all the difference. Itâ€™s spicier than other brands like Thai Kitchen, so
reduce the quantity of paste if necessary. I find this recipe, as written,
makes a curry thatâ€™s not too spicy as far as Thai food goes. Let me know how
you fare with this recipe for Thai red curry pork!

The spice level and taste was great but if you follow this recipe the way it
is written it will be entirely too thick. I looked at other recipes and they
use 1 cup of broth to thin the sauce a little bit.

Lauren, I'm sorry you weren't happy with the thickness of the recipe. It's a
good idea to thin it out if that's what you prefer.

Nice, and spicy! I added snap peas from my garden and sweet peppers that were
in the frig with red onion. Nummy!

I bought really fresh curry. This recipe is too spicy. When I make it again ,
I I will use way less than 2oz of red curry paste. I would also increase the
amount of coconut milk and sugar. So this recipe for me is not that good , if
it requires this much of an adjustment!

Sorry the spice level was too much for you, Erlene. That's the thing about
spiciness, it's so individualized ðŸ™‚

I'm a heat wimp, but once I added the rice, the seasoning heat was fine.  
Everyone is able to bump up whatever seasoning one wants. I added more lime
juice because I like that taste.  
Shhhh, I've eaten this dish 3 days straight because I liked it so much. Great
recipe!

I love Maesri and Mae-ploy. I like my curry very spicy so I usually use the
whole can when using Maesri. This was a very nice repipe with the bamboo and
kaffir leaves.

Thank you for giving me the courage to cook Thai food. I used this curry
recipe, the ingredients from the Instant Pot version, and your foolproof
Instant Pot jasmine rice. I did add some peanut butter. The sauce is so creamy
and the peanut butter lets me make it spicy, but something my son loves too.

I need to try this. I love this dish but I bought a huge pouch of paste that
it is too vinegary and hot as heck! I just finished it tonight so Iâ€™ll buy the
brand you recommend. I also usually thin with a cup or two of broth like you
recommended against. Third, Iâ€™m on keto so no sugar or rice :(. So Splenda and
I get cauliflower rice. Really puts a damper on my red curry craving!! Thank
you again

I like the Maesri too. And the fish sauce, kaffir lime leaf and thai basil
make this the real deal. Cheers for a super tasty weeknight meal!`
