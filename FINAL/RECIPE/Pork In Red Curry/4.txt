What can I say, Easy,great tasting and only takes 30 minutes. I tweeted mine a
bit because we love hot Thai food so I used my own home grown chili peppers
and 6-8 tablespoons of red curry paste. I also add bamboo shoots. I prefer
pork in leau of chicken just has a better flavor profile. Try this one you
will not be sorry.
