A quick and easy pork curry that can be cooked in minutes.

Useful Tips:

It is important to fry the paste in oil first to release the aromas of the
aromatic herbs and spices.

If your canned coconut milk has seperated into a thick cream and coconut
water, this is ideal for an authentically cooked curry. Take the thicker
creamy section and add to the paste. Fry and reduce until the oil starts to
seperate from the paste and coconut mixture. At this moment, add the remaining
waterey part of the coconut milk and bring the curry to the boil.

Slice proteins such as chicken, beef and pork into thin slices no more than
0.5cm wide. Add these to the boiling curry raw – they will cook until tender
in just under 5 minutes. By adding the meat raw, it enables all the flavours
of the paste to infuse the meat and creates a more tender curry.

If using fish in your Thai curry, it is better to poach it rather than boil
(as this can break upthe fish’s delicate flesh. Reduce the heat to a simmer
after the fish has been added, and cook until transluscent and tender.

Vegetables should be added according to their size and density. The larger
more dense vegetables will need longer to cook so add them earlier on in the
cooking.

Don’t forget to season the curry with Thai Fish Sauce (Nahm Pla) and sugar to
taste, towards the end of cooking. A green curry should be slightly more salty
than sweet. Red should be sweeter.
