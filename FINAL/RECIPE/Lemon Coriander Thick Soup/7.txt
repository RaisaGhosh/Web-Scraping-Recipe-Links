# How to Make Lemon Coriander Soup | Vegetarian

Jump to Recipe Print Recipe

Jump to Recipe

_This **Lemon Coriander Soup recipe** is a clear soup recipe with the lovely
aroma of coriander, the flavour of lemon and some crunchy veggies. Made from
the stalks of coriander, which normally goes into the bin, this soup is highly
aromatic and flavourful. Neither cornflour nor vegetable stock is used in this
recipe._

_Did I tell you that this Lemon and Coriander soup is vegan as well as gluten-
free?_

###

## **Recipe Without Vegetable Stock & Cornflour**

**The Lemon Coriander Soup that I make is actually a clear soup with the
lovely aroma of coriander, the flavour of lemon and some crunchy veggies.**

I do not add any thickening agent like cornflour or gram flour.

And do you know which stock I use for making this soup? Any guesses? No, itâ€™s
not the vegetable stock.

**The stock of this Lemon Coriander Soup is made with coriander stalks**. And
thatâ€™s the real beauty of this soup.

Call it **Best out of Waste** or whatever, but coriander stalks, are used for
making this soup.

## Ingredients

### Coriander Stalks

Coriander stalks are nothing but the thin stems of coriander that remain after
removing the leaves.

These stalks are full of flavour and aroma. Do you know that coriander stalks
are one of the main ingredients in Thai Cooking?

Normally, for making chutney or garnishing, I use them along with leaves. But
if I plan to make Lemon Coriander Soup, then I purposefully collect the
stalks, maybe for a day or two and then make this soup.

This soup made from coriander stalks stock is so different and flavourful as
compared to that made from vegetable stock.

**No stalksâ€¦ No Lemon Coriander Soup.** Yes, I would rather prefer not to make
this soup if the stalks are not handy than to use vegetable stock.

## **Jain Lemon Coriander Soup**

I add neither onion nor garlic. As you know both onion and garlic have a
strong flavour so I donâ€™t want to play with the aroma of coriander. So, this
soup is perfect for my Jain friends too.

## **Step By Step Recipe**

  * Take coriander stalks.

  * Rinse them thoroughly in the water maybe 3 to 4 times to get rid of all dirt and grime.

  * Boil these with lemongrass and 1 or 2 cups water in the pressure cooker, for 2 whistles.
  * Blend. (I used a hand mixer)

  * Slice veggies, as thinly as possible.

  * Heat a pan, put sliced veggies. Toss

  * Pass stalks stock through a sieve and put it in the vessel.

  * Add water. Boil for 2 to 3 minutes.
  * Add chopped coriander. Give just one boil.
  * Switch off the flame. Add lemon juice.
  * Serve with love, soup sticks optional.

## **Tip For Perfect Outcome**

  * Coriander leaves lose their colour if boiled too long. Similarly, Vitamin C in the lemon juice gets destroyed once it is boiled. 
  * So, to reap the full benefits of this soup, add coriander leaves and lemon juice in the end.

Print Recipe

### Ingredients

  * 100 g Bunch of Coriander/Cilantro
  * Few Sprigs of Lemongrass Fresh or Dried (Optional)
  * 1/4 Cup Vegetables Carrot, Cabbage, Broccoli etc, (cut into paper-thin slices)
  * Salt to taste
  * 1 Lemon
  * Black Pepper to taste
  * 1 Tsp Chili Sauce Optional

### Instructions

  * Take the bunch of coriander, remove the roots, if any.

  * Now remove the leaves and reserve these for later use.

  * After removing the leaves, you are left with stalks which means the thin stems. Wash these stalks thoroughly in water.

  * Put the cleaned and washed coriander stalks and lemongrass in the pressure cooker along with some water, approximately 1 to 2 cups.

  * Close the lid and boil these for 2 whistles.

  * While the stock is boiling, in the meantime, you do other preparations. Wash coriander leaves and finely chop them and keep them aside. Also, slice veggies, as thinly as possible.

  * Once the stock cools down, blend everything, that is the stalks and the water in the blender. You can even use a hand mixer and blend in the pressure cooker also even when hot.

  * After blending, pass everything through a strainer. This is your lovely, aromatic, green coloured stock.

  * Put a vessel on the gas stove, add sliced veggies in it. Toss it 2-3 times. If you want to add onion and garlic, then add 2 or 3 drops of oil and saute these.

  * Put the stalks stock in the vessel.

  * Add salt, chilli sauce and roughly 2 cups water and boil it for 2 to 3 minutes.

  * Lastly, add lots of chopped coriander leaves and give the last boil. (Reserve some for Garnishing)

  * Switch off the flame, squeeze lemon juice.

  * Garnish with some more chopped coriander.

  * Serve with love, bread optional.

### Notes

  1. I have used total 4 cups of water for 100 g of coriander. Some water while boiling the stalks and the rest with the soup. You may adjust the quantity of water depending upon the stalks quantity and quality.
  2. Add coriander leaves only towards the end to enjoy their lovely green colour. If boiled for too long, they may get discoloured.
  3. Put lemon juice also, in the end, to enjoy the full benefits of Vitamin C in it.
  4. I have used cabbage, carrot and broccoli. (Mushrooms, we don't like and cauliflower was out of stock that day). Instead of using a knife, tear cabbage into small pieces.
  5. You may add green chillies instead of green chilli sauce.
  6. Lemongrass adds lovely flavour but you can very well make it without it also as it is slightly difficult to procure always.
