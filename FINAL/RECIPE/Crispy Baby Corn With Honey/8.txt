## Delicious and juicy honey chilli baby corn skewers are one of the best
recipes for vegetarian when looking for options other than potato based
dishes.

How many of us make fried potato snack in any form or another when guest's
arrive. These baby corn skewers are a sure shot show stopper at any party.

If you enjoy spicy, sweet and tangy flavors then this recipe is for you.

The base of the sauce is picked up from my recipe Crispy Honey Chilli Potatoes
and converted into this delicious baby corn snack. This recipe is perfect for
house parties, cocktails, kitties or when entertaining vegetarian crowd. They
will get tough competition from they non vegetarian counterparts.
