crispy baby corn fritters |  
  
baby corn fritters is a quick and interesting starter which is sure to garner
you praise at a cocktail party, kids birthday party and even a kitty party.
Learn how to make Indian style baby corn fritters.  
  
To make fried baby corn, combine maida, cornflour, curd, chilli powder, garlic
paste, baking powder and salt along with approx. ½ cup of water in a deep bowl
and mix well using a whisk to make a thick batter. Dip each baby corn halve
into the batter and deep-fry in hot oil, a few at a time, till they turn
golden brown in colour from all the sides. Drain on an absorbent paper. Serve
immediately with chilli-garlic sauce.  
  
Crunchy and tasty, these perfectly golden-coloured crispy baby corn fritters
are a sight to behold and a treat to bite into! It is also quite easy to
prepare, because the procedure does not require it to be marinated. Just mix,
dip and fry – it’s as easy as that.  
  
Kids will love to have baby corn 65 as an After School Treats, while adults
would enjoy it thoroughly as a starter, or as a Evening Tea Snacks served
along with chilli-garlic sauce. If you wish you can also serve with Schezuan
sauce.  
  
While the cornflour is added to make the Indian style baby corn fritters
crispy, the addition of curd makes the batter creamy and smooth. Serving them
immediately is very important to enjoy its crispiness. Try it and you will
realise that it’s difficult to stop even after a few pieces.  
  
Tips for baby corn fritters. 1. Do not make the batter too much in advance.
The addition of salt in it might make the batter runny. 2. The batter should
coat the baby corn well. 3. Fry only a few baby corn halves at a time. Too
many pieces at a time in the oil might lead to the baby corn pieces sticking
to each other.
