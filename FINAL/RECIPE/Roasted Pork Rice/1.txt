## Ingredients

  * 2 tablespoons soy sauce 
  * 1 teaspoon honey 
  * 1 tablespoon sesame oil 
  * 1 tablespoon vegetable or canola oil 
  * 1 medium yellow onion, diced 
  * 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger 
  * 4 cups cooked long-grain rice 

  * 1 1/4 pounds hoisin-glazed roast pork, cut into 1/4-inch pieces 
  * Salt
  * 3 eggs, scrambled 
  * 1 cup bean sprouts, roughly chopped 
  * 3 scallions, chopped 
  * 1/2 cup frozen and thawed peas 

## Chef notes

Rice is my comfort food, so there's nothing I love better than a big bowl of
rice filled with meat and veggies. The bean sprouts are essential here; they
add a great crunch that makes every bite more exciting. Peas aren't a
traditional ingredient, but I like adding them for their color and sweetness.
In fact, this is a great recipe for using up any extra veggies that are taking
up space in your fridge—toss in grated carrots, diced zucchini, chopped
broccoli, or anything else you like.

## Preparation

1.

In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, honey, and sesame oi. Set
aside.

2.

In a wok or large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion
and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, about 4 minutes.
Add the ginger and cook for another minute. Add the rice, mixing well and
breaking up any clumps as you go. Stir in the roast pork.

3.

Add the soy sauce mixture and 1 teaspoon salt and stir well, distributing the
sauce evenly in the rice. Stir in the eggs, bean sprouts, scallions, and peas.
Taste for seasoning and serve hot.
