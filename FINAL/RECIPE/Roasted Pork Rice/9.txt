##  Directions

  1. Heat 1/2 tablespoon of the peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add eggs and tilt pan to coat the surface. Cook eggs in an even layer until cooked through, flipping halfway through cooking (about 2 minutes per side). Remove eggs, dice into small pieces and set aside. 
  2. To the same pan, heat remaining peanut oil. Add onion, garlic and ginger and cook 2 minutes. Add diced pork and cook 3 minutes, until golden brown. Add rice, soy sauce and sesame oil and cook 2 minutes to heat through. Season, to taste, with salt and black pepper. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro. 
  3. Transfer to a serving plate and top with chopped eggs.
