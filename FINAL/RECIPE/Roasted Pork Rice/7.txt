Ingredients  Method

#### Ingredients

Add all to trolley

  * 480g pork belly strips, sliced into very thin strips
  * 4 spring onions , finely sliced, separating the whites from the greens
  * 2 red chilli, finely sliced
  * 2 garlic cloves, finely sliced
  * 600g cooked long grain rice
  * 2 eggs
  * 1 tbsp fish sauce
  * 1 tbsp light soy sauce

#### Method

###### Step 1

Pop the pork belly strips in a bowl with salt and pepper, then give it a mix.

###### Step 2

Heat a wok over a medium heat. Add the pork belly strips in batches and fry
until super crispy and golden. Remove with a slotted spoon before repeating
with the remaining pork belly.

###### Step 3

Pour away around half the pork fat. Add the spring onion whites, garlic and
red chilli to the wok and fry for 2 mins until fragrant.

###### Step 4

Tip the cooked rice into the pan along with your crispy pork belly and stir
fry for a few mins more

###### Step 5

Make a well in the middle of the wok. Crack the eggs into the centre and mix
until the yolks and whites are combined. Allow their texture to firm up,
stirring to break up the eggs. Mix them into the rest of the rice once they
are totally set.

###### Step 6

Add the fish sauce and soy sauce along with some salt and pepper, then give it
all a final mix.

###### Step 7

Spoon into bowl and top with the green spring onion slices. Serve and enjoy.
