Veg manchurian recipe made with mixed vegetables, soya sauce, tomato sauce &
pantry ingredients. Chinese vegetable manchurian is a popular dish from
****Indo-chinese cuisine****. The term Manchuria refers to a region in North
East China and people from that region were known as Manchus or Manchurians.
The first Indian-Chinese manchurian dish (made with chicken) was born in 1975
in the Chinese restaurants of India which looked similar to the dishes from
Manchu cuisine.

* * *

Since a wider population of Indians are vegetarians eventually many vegetarian
versions were born. **Gobi manchurian**, **veg manchurian** , **Paneer
manchurian** and **mushroom manchuria** are some popular versions of this
dish.

## About Veg Manchurian

Veg manchurian is an Indian-Chinese appetizer where crisp fried vegetable
balls are dunked in slightly sweet, sour and hot manchurian sauce. These balls
are super delicious & crisp, the sauce is even more addictive and tasty.
Manchurian can be made to a dry, semi-dry or gravy dish.

The dry & the semi-dry manchurian is mostly relished as an appetizer while the
manchurian gravy is served as a side with **fried rice** or **hakka noodles**.
Vegetable manchurian makes for a great dish for parties, family dinners or
weekend dinners.

### This recipe

In this post I share a easy recipe to make perfectly delicious veg manchurian
where the balls turn out to be crisp and light, with a super flavorful and
finger-licking good manchurian sauce. I also share tips and tricks to make a
perfectly smoky sauce where you will taste & smell the real Chinese flavors.

With this recipe you can make dry, semi-dry or gravy versions. If making the
gravy version, I suggest using bread crumbs to keep the balls crisp for
longer. You won't taste the bread in the balls but the bread crumbs will soak
up the excess moisture from the veggies and keep them crisp longer.

More details in the step by step instructions below. If you are making this
for a party, then add the balls to the manchurian gravy just before serving.
This way they remain crisp for longer.

I have adapted this veg manchurian recipe from this **chicken manchurian
recipe** on the blog.

## How to Make Veg Manchurian (Stepwise Photos)

### Preparation

1\. It is good not to use vegetables from refrigerator as they let out lot of
moisture and the veg balls will not turn crispy. I usually keep the veggies
out of refrigerator the previous day.

2\. Cut cabbage to large cubes and add them to luke warm water. Allow to rest
for 3 to 4 mins. Drain completely and allow to air dry until used. Chop
finely. I prefer to air dry on a cotton cloth after chopping.

Prepare veggies for balls  
1¼ cups cabbage fine chopped  
¼ cup spring onions fine chopped  
¼ cup beans (optional) fine chopped  
½ cup grated carrot (1 medium)  
2 tablespoons grated or minced bell peppers  
Grate 2 garlic cloves and half inch ginger (1 teaspoon paste).

3.Prepare veggies for the sauce  
fine chop ½ tablespoon ginger & ¾ tablespoon garlic  
¼ cup spring onions fine chopped  
¼ cup bell peppers chopped

### Making veg balls

4\. Before you begin to make the balls, begin to heat the oil in a kadai /
deep pan. If you do not intend to use bread crumbs in the recipe, this step is
very crucial.

The balls that are made without using bread crumbs have to straight away go
for frying else they will let out moisture and the balls will not turn crispy
or may even break.

5\. Add chopped cabbage, carrot, beans,capsicum and spring onions to a mixing
bowl. Next add very little salt, ½ teaspoon pepper and ginger garlic paste. Do
not add more salt as it will let out more moisture from the veggies.

6\. Then add 3 tablespoons cornstarch (corn flour) and 3 tablespoons all-
purpose flour (maida).

7\. Mix gently to bind the ingredients.

8\. Make the balls without squeezing the mixture a lot. These balls will be
soft and you may also need to grease your palms if the mixture is sticky.

But if the balls do not hold shape, then it is not good to go ahead and fry as
they may break in the oil.

Some variety of veggies especially tender ones, frozen or from cold storage
let out lot of moisture and will break the balls while frying.

### Manchurian Balls with Bread Crumbs

9\. You can also add ¼ to ½ cup bread crumbs for extra crisp texture. If you
intend to make this for a party, then do use them. This will help the balls to
remain crisp for at least 2 hours. You can make these ahead and dunk in the
sauce just before serving.

Veg manchurian balls made without bread crumbs are good to serve immediately
after making as they do not remain crisp for longer. Any amount of cornstarch
or maida / plain flour will not do the job of bread crumbs.

10\. These balls will be firmer and less sticky. For this recipe you will get
about 12 to 14 balls depending on the size.

### Frying Balls

11\. Heat oil in a kadai. Gently slide a small portion of dough to the oil to
check if it is hot enough. The dough has to rise steadily without browning.
This is the right temperature. Fry veg balls immediately on a medium flame.
Leave them untouched until they firm up in the oil, if you have not used bread
crumbs. Later stir often to fry them evenly.

12\. Drain them to a kitchen tissue when they turn golden and crisp. These
balls take long time to fry, so it is good to discard the oil used for frying.

13\. I prefer my Indo chinese dishes to be brighter in color rather than
brownish so I use red chili powder or paste. This is optional. You can make a
fine paste of ½ to ¾ teaspoon red chilli powder with very little water. Set
this aside.

14\. Dissolve corn starch  
For veg Manchurian gravy: Dissolve ¾ tablespoon of cornstarch with ¼ cup of
water.  
Manchurian dry: Dissolve 1 teaspoon cornstarch with 2 tablespoon of water. Set
this aside.

### Make Manchurian Sauce

15\. Heat up a wok with 1½ tablespoons of fresh oil. Saute chopped ¾
tablespoon garlic and ½ tablespoon ginger for a min. For the great smoky
Chinese flavors use a carbon steel wok & cook from here on a highest flame
until you add the sauces at a later step.

16\. Add ¼ cup spring onions and ¼ cup finely chopped capsicum. Saute for 1 to
2 mins on the highest flame possible without burning. This imparts a unique
aroma to the sauce.

17\. Add 1 tablespoon soya sauce or tamari. You can add more or less to suit
your taste.

18\. Add 2 tablespoons red chili sauce (or any hot sauce) and 1 tablespoon
tomato sauce/ ketchup (optional). Adjust to suit your taste.

19\. This step is optional. Stir the red chili paste and pour it. Use a milder
variety chili powder like kashmiri.

20\. Make sure the flame is low. Stir the cornstarch mixture and pour it to
the pan.

21\. Next stir immediately.

22\. Pour 1 cup water for gravy version and half cup water for dry version and
stir well. I am making a gravy here.

Advertisement

23\. Taste this and then add vinegar, sugar, pepper & salt, everything to suit
your taste. The manchurian sauce has to be slightly sour, sweet and very very
mildly hot.

24\. Keep stirring and cook on a medium flame until the sauce thickens. Sauce
will thicken upon cooling. So the right consistency is when it is slightly
thick. Taste test and add more soya sauce or chilli sauce or tomato ketchup to
suit your taste.

25\. Do not add the balls to very hot sauce. Allow it to cool down a bit for
about 5 to 7 mins. Add the balls to the manchurian sauce just before you
serve. If the sauce turns very thick, you can add little hot water and stir.

Garnish veg manchurian with spring onions.

**Veg manchurian** can be served as a appetizer or as a side with  
 **Fried rice  
Veg noodles  
Hakka noodles**

## Pro Tips

  * For authentic Chinese smoky flavors use a carbon steel wok and stir fry on a highest flame until you add the sauces, then turn down the flame and cook further. 
  * Do not add a lot of flour or starch to the mixed veggies as they make the manchurian balls hard. Instead you can add bread crumbs.
  * Adding too much of bread crumbs will alter the taste of the balls. You should not have the dominating taste of bread in the balls. So add more only if needed.
  * The manchurian balls can be fried in the paniyaram pan, just skip the flour and beans. Use only the bread crumbs. Fry them on a medium flame turning them all around for even cooking.
  * If frying the balls in the paniyaram pan then, ensure you do not make the balls too big. I cook these in a cast iron paniyaram pan so they cook well inside but I am not sure if they turn out good in a non stick.

### Instructions

mins.

& salt to a mixing bowl. Mix everything well.

  * ▢

without breaking.

  * ▢ 

You can also optionally roll these balls in corn starch.

  * ▢ 

You can make about 12 to 14 balls. Set aside all the vegetable balls.

  * ▢ 

**Frying balls** - Heat oil in a deep pan for deep frying.

  * ▢ 

Check if the oil is hot enough by dropping a small portion of the dough in hot
oil.

  * ▢ 

The dough has to come up without browning. This is the right temperature.

  * ▢ 

Gently slide the balls in hot oil & fry on a medium flame.

  * ▢ 

Do not disturb them for 1 min after the balls are dropped in oil.

  * ▢ 

They will be delicate and may break if you have not used bread crumbs.

  * ▢ 

After few seconds of frying, you can keep stirring and fry until they turn
golden.

  * ▢ 

Drain them on a kitchen tissue.

  * ▢ 

**Baking in Oven - **Preheat the oven and bake the balls on a greased wire
rack placed over a tray at 200 C for 20 to 23 mins.

  * ▢ 

Turn them to the other sides after every 8 mins.

  * ▢ 

Please be alert as the timings may vary depending on the size of the balls.

onions.

  * ▢ 

Serve veg manchurian with veg fried rice or noodles.

### Notes

Bread crumbs: Adding bread crumbs won't alter the taste. But will help the
balls to remain crisp for at least 2 hours. If making for a party to serve
later, then I highly suggest using bread crumbs. You may skip it if you are
going to serve right after making.

Alternative quantities provided in the recipe card are for 1x only, original

Do you think I would be able to air fry the balls? Would they hold their
texture for when I put it in the sauce?

Hi Swasthi,  
The manchurian balls were crisp on the outside after frying but they stayed
moist inside. I could see the raw flour and corn starch after cutting through.
Could you please suggest some tips ?

__Reply to   saloni

Hi Saloni,  
Looks like they haven't cooked well from inside. The balls have to small as
shown in the pictures and have to be fried on a medium heat. I think the
outside became brown too quickly and the inside remained undercooked either
because the balls were big or the oil was too hot or too much flour or too
little vegetables. Try frying them again. Heat the oil well and then reduce
the heat to low to medium heat.

Thank you for this recipe - it was delicious!!! I did cut down on the chili
paste and only used 1 tablespoon, but still has heat and we both loved it!!  
I did initially try baking them, but they weren’t browning so I fried them in
oil - perfect!

You mean fry the balls or just the cabbage. You can always refry the balls.
But if you mean only the cabbage I am not sure if that works. Hope this helps

Hi Swasthi  
You have said to skip the flour if making the manchurian balls in paniyaram
pan.  
But will the balls form?  
Can instead 1 tbsp of cornflour & maida be used?  
Thanks for the tips in this receipe.

Hi Pooja  
Yes skip the flour and use bread crumbs. I felt the balls had the raw taste of
flour when cooked in paniyaram pan. Yes the balls will form. Squeeze the
veggies well and add as much bread crumbs as needed until the mixture binds.
Hope this helps.

Hi Swasthi  
My querry is, for making manchurian balls do we have to add a little amount of
water and instead of bread crumbs can i simply add a slice of bread(by
crushing through hands)into it. One more, how can i replace the corn flour to
ararowt(in quantity).  
Looking forward for your reply.??

swasthi

__Reply to   Payal

Hi Payal,  
1\. No water is used for the balls.  
2\. The purpose of using bread crumbs is to absorb the excess moisture from
the veggies. Using fresh bread serves no purpose here. Instead you can skip
the bread completely.  
3\. All Arrowroot powders are not same. There is no one correct quantity for
replacing corn flour with arrowroot powder. For the balls you can use the same
amount but for the gravy you have to experiment a bit. Like example if the
gravy becomes too runny then mix little more arrowroot with water and add. If
it becomes too thick then pour little more water. Hope these help

Hi Geeta,  
Yes you can prepare the balls and then the sauce both separately and then just
mix before serving. You should be very careful while making sauce in large
quantities as usually they don't turn out as good as with small quantities.
Thanks for rating the recipe.

Hi Jennie  
Yes you can refrigerate the dough balls or even freeze them. Just bring them
to room temperature before frying. You can also roll the balls in some flour,
dust off and then fry. Thank you so much for rating the recipe. I have already

Hi Priya,  
Yes you can make the balls 3 hours before but do use bread crumbs which i
mentioned as a optional ingredient. It should help the balls to remain crisp.
Before adding to the sauce, if you find them soft (due to weather conditions)
then you can crisp them in a preheated oven for 3 to 5 mins at 180 C. You can
also crisp them in paniyaram (gunta ponganalu) pan. Hope this helps
