Veg Manchurian Dry Recipe In Hindi (हिन्दी में पढ़े)

Veg Manchurian Dry Recipe In Gujarati (ગુજરાતી માં વાંચો)

Ingredients:  
---  
For Manchurian Balls  
1/3 cup Maida (all purpose flour)  
2 tablespoons Cornflour (corn starch)  
3/4 cup grated Carrot  
3/4 cup grated Cabbage  
1/2 cup finely chopped Capsicum  
3 tablespoons finely chopped Spring Onion  
2 Green Chillies, finely chopped  
1 teaspoon + for deep frying Cooking Oil  
Salt  
1/4 teaspoon Pepper Powder  
For Spicy Sauté  
1 medium Red Onion, diced  
1/2 cup Green Capsicum (bell pepper), diced  
1/2 tablespoon finely chopped Ginger  
2 Green Chillies, slit and cut in halves  
1/2 tablespoon finely chopped Garlic  
2 tablespoons finely chopped Spring Onion  
2 tablespoons Cooking Oil  
1 tablespoons Soy Sauce  
1/2 tablespoon Chilli Sauce  
2 tablespoons Tomato Ketchup  
  
Directions for Chinese Manchurian Balls:

  1. Take a medium size bowl, add grated carrot, grated cabbage, chopped capsicum, chopped green chilli and spring onion followed by 1 teaspoon oil, pepper powder, maida, cornflour and salt.

  2. Mix all ingredients properly. Prepare small round balls from the mix. Do not add water in the mix for making balls, as water released by vegetables will be enough to bind them. In case mix does not bind properly and small balls cannot be made, add some water in the mixture.

  3. Heat cooking oil in a pan. When oil is hot enough to deep fry, add and deep fry raw balls on medium flame until they turn golden brown.

  4. Drain oil from cooked balls and transfer to plate having paper towel spread on it (to remove excess oil from deep fried veg balls)

Directions for Sauté:

  1. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok (wide mouthed, thin-bottomed pan) on high flame. Add diced onion, diced capsicum, green chilli, chopped ginger and chopped garlic and sauté for 2-3 minutes or until they become slightly tender.

  2. Add soy sauce, tomato ketchup, chilli sauce and salt; mix well.

  3. Add fried manchurian balls and spring onion. Toss and cook on high flame for 1-2 minutes.

  4. Best dry vegetable manchurian is ready.

Tips and Variations:

  * Do not add water in the mix for making balls as water from vegetables will be sufficient to glue together all chopped veggies. However, in case mix does not bind properly and small balls cannot be made, add 1 or 2 tablespoons water in the mixture.
  * We have avoided MSG (Ajinomoto) in this recipe to make it healthier and suitable for kids. However, you can add a pinch of Ajinomoto (MSG) while preparing veg mixture for balls to get authentic Chinese taste.
  * Garnish it with finely chopped spring onion for eye catchy appeal.

Taste: Moderately spicy

Serving Ideas: Due to dry texture of this dish, it is generally served as
starter or snack. It tastes best when served with hot and spicy veg fried rice
or hot and sour soup.

Very happy...Thanks for giving easy methods of recipe...Turned out veryb

Jan 06, 2017 by Suma

Vegetable manuchira : Steam the vegetables and let it cool then add flour,
this makes manchuria soft, also add right amount of flour to the steamed
vegetables - just enough to bind the vegetables together  
  
Palak paneer: - add nutmeg and yogurt to the palak paneer instead of cream -
it tastes like dhaba style.  

 **Response:** Thank you Suma for sharing the tips.

Good recipe but my manchurian balls were sticky and chewy. What should I do?  

 **Response:** Manchurian balls turn sticky and chewy if they are deep fried
over low flame or if the flour is added more than given measurements.

Every one from my family liked the taste. The main thing is without using MSG
it turned out well. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Jun 04, 2015 by Bhoomiben Patel

I made vegetarian machurian following by your recipe but my manchurian balls
always turn soft with too much oil that is why my family does not like and I
would prefer crispy manchurian balls.  
  
Can you please advise me how I can make crispy balls?  
  
Thank you,  
Bhoomi  

 **Response:** Hi Bhoomi, thanks for trying the recipe. If you deep fry the
manchurian balls over low flame then they will absorb more oil. Follow the
given steps to make them perfect.  
1\. Add the balls in oil when oil is medium hot. To check the oil is hot
enough or not, drop a small portion of batter in oil and if it comes on the
surface immediately without changing its color then it is ready.  
2\. Always deep fry them over medium flame until light brown and crispy from
outer side.  
3\. Do not deep fry them over low flame or high flame.

you have presented it in a very easy and simple way. Good job and thanks. You

Apr 27, 2015 by Ankit kaushik

Is there any substitute of cornflour / corn starch? If it's not available
then?  

 **Response:** Hi Ankit, corn flour/ corn starch is used to make the outer
layer crispy. If it is not available, you can use arrowroot powder.

Mar 15, 2015 by Himani Khaneja

I tried this recipe just now and it's so yummy. Just so love it.  

Feb 25, 2015 by Falguni

Excellent. Manchurian came out as the recipe was said. It was perfect every
one enjoyed.  
Thanks  

Feb 19, 2015 by Kanchan

Hello,  
I tried it yesterday, it was very yummy.... just wanted to say that this is
the best recipe I have ever tried..  
Thanks a lot! Keep sharing such wonderful recipes..  

Feb 18, 2015 by Falguni

It was best way explained step by step usually I am nervous with reading
recipe and doing but it came out very good. Only one problem was that the
balls were very soft what could be the reason? The mixture was not too soft,
it was perfect. The balls coming out brown and nice but too soft.  

 **Response:** Hi Falguni, thanks for trying the recipe. Let me ask you one
question, were the balls crispy from outside or not?  
1\. I think the reason behind the soft balls is the wrong temperature of oil.
If you deep fry the balls when oil is too hot (when smoke comes out), balls
will turn brown immediately but they will remain soft and uncooked from
inside. Deep fry them over medium flame to cook them evenly and crispy from
outside.  
2\. Do not skip the corn flour (corn starch) because it helps to make outer
layer crispy.

Feb 09, 2015 by Jarin

Very nice and tasty recipe. I make it every week. Well done. When we fry the
veg balls, they are crispy, but as soon as we deep the balls in gravy they
become soft. So what can we do so that the balls remain crispy in the gravy
also? Please suggest. Thanks.  

 **Response:** Hi Jarin, you cannot keep the balls crispy in gravy for longer
period because manchurian absorbs the moisture from the gravy and turns soft.
If you like the crispy balls then add them in the gravy just before the
serving.

Why do you not use ajinomoto in chinese fried rice & manchurian dry receipe?  

 **Response:** Hi, ajinomoto enhances the flavor but not good for health so,
we have not used it in our most of the recipes.

Dec 13, 2014 by Smita

Tried the recipe today. The recipe is explained well however, the balls turned
out very soft and started breaking while frying. Is there any way could I fix
this issue the next time I try to make it?  

 **Response:** Hi smita, the reasons behind the balls started breaking while
deep-frying are given below.  
1\. Make sure that oil is hot enough when you add the ball in oil for deep
frying otherwise ball starts breaking. To check oil is hot enough or not, add
a drop of batter in oil and check 1. if it comes upward immediately without
changing its color then oil is ready, 2. if it comes upward immediately and
turned brown then oil is too hot, 3. if it doesn't come on the surface, oil is
not enough hot.  
2\. If you are not able to make the balls from the mixture because of excess
water released from vegetables, add a tablespoon of maida and mix again. You
can also squeeze out the excess water from grated carrots and cabbage before
making the mixture.

Can you suggest something in replacement of soya sauce and chilli sauce?  

 **Response:** Hi Priya, you cannot replace soy sauce with any other
ingredient, and for chili sauce, either you can add same amount of vinegar in
place of it or skip it.

They were hard..  

 **Response:** Hi Manisha, thanks for trying the recipe. Please see the
response provided to the following comment for the answers.

Jun 03, 2014 by Monika

manchurian balls are too hard n tough to eat...  

 **Response:** Hi Monika, thanks for trying the recipe. Manchurian balls could
turn hard in following situations.  
1\. If quantity of flour used is higher than the quantity mentioned in the
ingredients measurement. Please make sure that it is used in same quantity as
given in the measures.  
2\. If prepared mixture (in step-2) is too hard then manchurian balls will
turn hard. Make sure that prepared mixture is smooth. If vegetables do not
release enough water then add additional water in the mixture.  
3\. If they are deep fried on low flame instead of on medium flame - they will
turn hard and oily.

overjoyed and said its just finger licking one. Thank you soo much, i love to
cook yummy food for my hubby. Now I have to prepare some more Manchurian, he's
just loving it.  

 **Response:** Thanks Manjushree.

Jan 24, 2013 by Sejal

Thanks for the explain my mistake I forgot to squeeze out water but I think
it\'s plain flour as well because it\'s not only soft it\'s test flour as well
but any way I\'ll try it again thanks again.  

 **Response:** Hi Sejal,  
  
Note that you need to squeeze out only the excess water but not all water
otherwise balls will not bind together and they may split during deep frying.

Jan 23, 2013 by Sejal desai

Hi I made manchurian using ur recipe & when I tried to eat it's soft inside
can u tell me why it's soft inside thanks for ur recipe  

 **Response:** Hi Sejal,  
  
Thanks for the feedback and trying our recipe. The manchurian balls will never
be as crispy inside as outside. However, if it's gooey inside then there could
be two reasons for it; 1) Too much water being released from vegetables and 2)
Insufficient deep-frying or deep-frying on high flame. The solution to this
problem is to squeeze out the excess water from grated carrots and cabbage as
well as deep-frying it on low to medium flame so that inside of balls cooks
properly while outside layer doesn't burn. If this still doesn't solve the
problem then you can reduce the quantity of maida to 1/4 cup and increase the
quantity of corn flour to 3 tablespoons. Extra cornflour will give it a
crispier texture. However, we recommend that you try the first two solutions
first.

Jul 24, 2012 by sajida

very well explained recipe, can't wait to try it.  

Jul 11, 2012 by Manu

This is an excellent recipe. i made it as it is with little modification in
amount of soya sauce and chilli sauce as my family likes bit spicy dishes and
it was a super hit at the table. next time i am going to make it with
ajinomoto as i believe it will add more taste.
