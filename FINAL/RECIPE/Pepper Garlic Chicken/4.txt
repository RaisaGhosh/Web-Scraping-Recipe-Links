# Garlic and Pepper Chicken

**Garlic and Pepper Chicken** (gai pad gratiem prik thai) is a very common
dish. You can use any meat -- pork, beef, shrimp, squid, etc. You can even
make a vegetarian one with tofu. It's a very easy and quick dish to make. It's
commonly eaten as a one-dish meal over rice, but it can be added to a family-
style meal. If sharing - serve it on a regular plate - not over rice.

## Ingredients

  * 1 chicken breast, sliced into thin bite-size pieces (3/4 cup)
  * 1/4 cup garlic cloves, smashed
  * 3/4 teaspoon palm sugar (or white sugar)
  * 3/4 teaspoon white pepper powder or :black pepper powder: (or mix 'em!)
  * 1 3/4 teaspoons fish sauce
  * 1-2 tablespoons oil (enough to coat bottom of pan)
  * 2-3 tablespoons water
  * 1 teaspoon coriander leaves (for garnish)

## Directions

  1. Rinse and cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces (see picture).
  2. Smash the garlic lightly with the side of a knife. Remove the skin if not using thin-skinned Thai garlic.
  3. Heat the oil in a pan until very hot. Add the garlic and keep stirring so it doesn't burn.
  4. When (very) lightly browned, add the chicken (or meat, or whatever you're using!). Cook until done (not raw). If it gets dry and sticky, add some water to the pan about 1-2 tablespoons at a time.
  5. Add the palm sugar, fish sauce and pepper. You may need to add a bit more water here so that it mixes well.
  6. Mix well and serve on rice (for a one-dish meal), or in a plate (to share with friends). Garnish with cilantro.

### Note:

If making a vegetarian version - pre-fry the tofu first until browned, remove,
then start with step 2. Substitute the fish sauce for :white soy sauce:.
