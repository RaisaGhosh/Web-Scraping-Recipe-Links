**Garlic chicken recipe in 20 minutes** - This Indian style garlic chicken has
been one of the favorites at home. Hot, spicy, flavorful & absolutely
delicious - all without deep frying the chicken. This goes well with plain
rice - rasam, Fried rice and Hakka noodles.

* * *

However you can also have this with chilli garlic noodles or chilli garlic
fried rice and you may also save sometime since the noodles & fried rice I
mentioned also use the same spice base.

My new found trick to tenderize the chicken which I learnt from my chicken
majestic, works well for this recipe too. I soaked the chicken strips
overnight in buttermilk along with salt and pepper.

I was surprised at this soft, tasty and tender chicken, all without deep
frying and it is egg free too. I am yet to try baking this. This is not any
restaurant style chicken starter but it tastes awesome and is ideal for a home
preparation. It is one of our favorites during the monsoon and winters.

To make the spice paste, you can tweak it a bit to suit your taste. For me
this turns out perfect.

Note for those who cannot blend and make a paste: mix red chili powder,
chopped and crushed garlic, vinegar, sugar, salt and 1 tbsp. water. Use this
paste for marinating.

### Ingredients (US cup = 240ml )

#### Marination

  * ‚ñ¢ 300 grams chicken strips or boneless cubes
  * ‚ñ¢ 4 tbsp Yogurt  / dahi / curd (do not use sour yogurt)
  * ‚ñ¢ Salt very little
  * ‚ñ¢ 1 pinch pepper

#### Seasoning

  * ‚ñ¢ 2 tbsp Oil
  * ‚ñ¢ 1 sprig  curry leaves
  * ‚ñ¢ ¬º tsp cumin
  * ‚ñ¢ 1 onions chopped finely

#### Ingredients for Chili garlic sauce

  * ‚ñ¢ 5 red chilies  or 3/4 tsp red chilli powder
  * ‚ñ¢ 5 garlic  cloves crushed
  * ‚ñ¢ ¬æ tbsp Vinegar
  * ‚ñ¢ ¬º tsp sugar (optional)
  * ‚ñ¢ Salt to taste

#### Garnish

  * ‚ñ¢ Coriander leaves few
  * ‚ñ¢ Onion wedges or rings
  * ‚ñ¢ Lemon

### Instructions

#### Prepration

  * ‚ñ¢

Mix yogurt, salt and pepper with ¬Ω to ¬æ cup water. Beat well and set aside.

  * ‚ñ¢

Wash chicken and soak it in the above prepared butter milk for 2 hours to
overnight in the refrigerator. Soaking for at least 6 hours is recommended to
get soft chicken.

  * ‚ñ¢

Blend and Make a paste of the ingredients mentioned for chili garlic sauce.

  * ‚ñ¢

Drain up the buttermilk and add the prepared sauce. Mix well and leave it for
5 minutes. If you want to prepare it at a later time, you can put it back in
the refrigerator.

#### Making garlic chicken

  * ‚ñ¢

Heat a pan with oil, add cumin and curry leaves, saute till the cumin begins
to splutter.

  * ‚ñ¢

Transfer the onions and fry till golden.

  * ‚ñ¢

Add the chicken and fry on a high heat for 2 to 3 mins. When you see the
chicken turning white, cover it with a lid and lower the heat and cook till
the chicken turns tender. This barely takes 5 mins if you are using strips

  * ‚ñ¢

Remove the lid and fry till the moisture evaporates and the sauce begins to
cling to the chicken. The longer it is roasted, the sauce becomes more
aromatic and tastier but the chicken tends to lose its tenderness. So take off
from the heat when it is of your liking. Take care not to burn, garlic burns
faster.

  * ‚ñ¢

Serve garlic chicken hot or warm.

Hi swasthi when cumin is required in curry recipes etc , is this cumin seeds
or ground cumin? Clarity would be appreciated. Thank you!

__Reply to   Roxy

Hi Roxy,  
For curry recipes, I usually do not use cumin powder. It is only the seeds.  
Just a note - I mention them differently  
For cumin - I write cumin or jeera  
For cumin powder - I write clearly cumin powder or jeera powder.  
Hope this helps. Thanks for reading

Hi Anil,  
You are welcome.  
Chicken is marinated with the chilli garlic sauce or paste. I have mentioned
this in step 4. Hope this helps

Hi Swasthi,

Thanks for the reply.  
So as I understand, take the marinated chicken from the fridge and then "Drain
up the buttermilk" means from the marinated chicken and then add the sauce to
the chicken and again keep for few hours. Right?

Regards  
Anil

I tried this and it worked very well. I put more garlic paste and also added
some red capsicum because the amount was too less for my mixer. Subbed honey
for sugar. I added the remaining curd as well as I felt guilty for throwing
it. Really good recipe, deceptively delicious for something so simple.

i am a vegetarian but cook non veg for my family so not very much aware about
the meat parts s, can u kindly explain me which part of chicken is called
"chicken strips?

Reply

swasthi

__Reply to   sudha seth

Hi Sudha  
I appreciate you. Chicken strips are boneless chicken meat just sliced to thin
strips. They can be from any part, but they are boneless tender meat which
gets cooked very very fast. Sometimes I buy these as they are available in
small packs say about 200 grams and they are easy to use. Just wash and use,
no cleaning. Strips are good for preparing appetizers only
