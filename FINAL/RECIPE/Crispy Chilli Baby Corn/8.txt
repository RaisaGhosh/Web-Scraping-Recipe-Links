# Chilli Baby Corn

Cold and wet weather is pleasant and a welcome change from the sultry summer
we've had this year. Comforting, like an occasional deep fried indulgence. But
unabated rain is anything but enjoyable. I prepared a spicy Indo-Chinese
appetizer, Chilli Baby Corn, which served as a perfect antidote, adding a
cheerful note to the day. Makes for a warm, well spiced appetizer.

Chilli Baby Corn Recipe

Marination: 10 mts, Prep & Cooking: 20 mts

Serves: 5 persons

Cuisine: Indo-Chinese

.

Ingredients:

1/4 kg baby corn, cut into 1″ pieces

2 small onions, quartered (optional)

6-7 tbsps spring onion whites

3-4 tbsps spring onion greens

1 tbsp chopped garlic

1 tbsp chopped ginger

2 tsp soya sauce

2 tsps vinegar

1 tbsp corn flour + 5 tbsps water

1/2 tbsp brown sugar

1 large green capsicum, cut into thin slices

1 1/2 tbsps tomato sauce

1 tsp green chilli paste

salt to taste

2 tbsps oil

**For marinade:** (marinate baby corn with below ingredients for 10 mts)

large pinch black pepper pwd

1/4 tsp ginger-garlic paste

salt to taste

1 tbsp corn flour + few tbsps water (the marinade should just coat the baby
corn)

1 Heat 2 tbsps oil in a flat pan, place the thinly coated baby corn pieces
next to one another and shallow fry till brown. Flip over and let it brown the
other side. Remove and keep aside.  
2 Heat a heavy bottomed vessel, pour the left over shallow fried oil (if
necessary add 1-2 tsps more oil), add the chopped ginger and garlic and saute
on high flame for about 30 secs. Add the chopped spring onion whites and
quartered onions and saute for 2-3 mts. Add sliced capsicum and stir fry on
high flame for 3 mts. Add green chilli paste, tomato paste, soy sauce,
vinegar, sugar and combine. Add the sauteed baby corn and toss for a mt on
high flame. Add 1/4 cup water and adjust salt if necessary.  
3 Add the cornflour water and combine on high flame, tossing the contents, for
3 mts. You will find that it becomes thick due to cornflour.  
4 Add the chopped spring onion greens and combine. Garnish with more spring
onion greens. Serve hot as a starter/appetizer.
