# About Shanghai Vegetable Rice Recipe:

Plain cooked rice and stir-fried bok choy taste great on their own, but
pairing them adds something extra. In this recipe for vegetable rice, adding
stir-fried vegetables to steaming rice means the rice is nicely infused with
their flavor. There are numerous variations on this eastern chinese dish. For
example, you can forego the mushrooms and add steamed chinese sausages, or
replace the bok choy with chinese cabbage. It makes a very nutritious side
dish that pairs nicely with cooked chicken, beef, or seafood, whether or not
youre preparing a complete chinese meal.
