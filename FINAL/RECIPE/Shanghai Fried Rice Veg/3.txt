This is the recipe for Shanghai fried rice, something more filling and varied
than the fried rice you may have encountered in Chinese takeout. This article
will introduce you to Chinese ingredients to help you familiarize with them a
bit more.

##

Ingredients

  * 1 kilogram (6 cups) cooked rice or less
  * 250 grams northern Chinese sausage
  * 200 grams (1 1/3 cups) green peas (freshest green peas only)
  * 100 grams (1 1/3 cups) lettuce
  * 150 grams (5.3 ounces) shrimp or more
  * Soy sauce
  * White pepper (optional)
  * 5 pieces of eggs
  * 100 grams (1 cup) spring onions
  * Garlic
  * Onion
  * Monosodium glutamate (MSG) (optional)
  * Salt

##

Steps

**Fluff and spread the cooked rice on a baking tray.** Let it cool. Cool
completely for best results.

    * This is so the rice dries enough to make a proper, non-mushy fried rice.
