# Stir Fried Seafood Noodles

by  Raymund * Published December 9, 2011 * Updated April 15, 2022

Jump to Recipe*Print Recipe

When Filipinos cook stir fried noodles the usual main ingredient would be
either pork or chicken and we rarely use seafood specially fish, might be
because we are used to eating our seafood as it is and rarely filleted, so we
barely see fish fillets in supermarkets and if you want one you have to ask
for it or fillet it on your own. But when I worked in Hong Kong I was exposed
to noodle dishes that used seafood and fish as their main ingredients and they
taste really good so good I there was one instance I ordered them almost every
day for a week, I like noodles and I really love seafood and combining them
together would be heaven. So this dish will be similar to the Filipino dish
called pancit canton but using seafood instead of the traditional chicken or
pork.

I like this seafood version Raymund, you know my hubby does not eat chicken
and pork so, this will be perfect to be made for him. Noodles are what I do
especially for a quick meal.
