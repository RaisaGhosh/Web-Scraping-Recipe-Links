## Directions

  1. Shell and devein the shrimp. Slice the scallops into half of their thickness. Remove excess moisture and cover lightly with the potato starch.

  2. Chop the cabbage into bite-size chunks and thinly slice the bamboo shoot into 4 cm (1.6 in.) lengths. Cut the shiitake mushrooms into 5 mm (0.2 in.) width pieces. Destring the snow peas and slice into half diagonally.

  3. Boil water in a wok with a small amount of salt (extra), quickly boil (1) and then drain in a colander.

  4. Wipe the wok dry, heat 1 Tbsp of the vegetable oil, sauté (2) and remove from the wok.

  5. Add 1 Tbsp of vegetable oil to the wok from (4), add in the noodles, 3 Tbsp of water (extra) and cook while separating the noodles. Return (3) and (4) to the wok, cook all together, season with (A) and then serve into bowls.

## Checkpoints

Devein Shrimp

Shrimp or prawns have a dark-colored intestinal tract (often called a vein)
running down the length of their back, this needs to be removed. For shrimps
in shells, before removing the shell, place a toothpick into the 2nd to 3rd
abdominal segment from the head and gently remove this. By slightly bending
the back this process is made easier. For headless shrimp, quite often the
intestinal tract has been removed with the head.
