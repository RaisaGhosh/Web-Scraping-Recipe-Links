# Thai Basil Fried Rice (vegetarian, dairy-free, GF option)

Jump to Recipe

## Can I make Thai Basil Fried Rice without Thai Basil?

No. Thai Basil offers a unique, sweet, and fragrant flavor. It is also the
main ingredient in this dish. Thai basil can be found at most Asian grocery
stores. If you can't find it, you can improvise with Italian basil, but the
flavor is NOT the same.

## Do I need to make this dish with Jasmine Rice?

**Jasmine Rice** is preferable when making Thai Basil Fried Rice, however feel
free to use Indian Basmati Rice or any brown rice also works.  

## Are Eggs necessary in this dish?

No. I love eggs in my fried rice, however if you don't care for eggs, skip
this last step.

## What other vegetables can I add to my Thai Basil Rice? What about protein?

Feel free to add sliced carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, green bell pepper, or
squash. Any vegetable you like really. For protein, you can add tofu, chicken,
or shrimp.

## Thai Basil Fried Rice is:

Fragrant  
Aromatic  
Delicious  
Flavorful  
Versatile (add your choice of protein)  
Vegetarian  
Gluten-Free option (use GF sauces)  
Vegan option (skip eggs, use vegan fish and oyster sauces)  

## How to make Thai Basil Fried Rice recipe step by step?

### Prep

1\. A day before (preferably), cook the Jasmin rice. Refrigerate overnight so
the rice hardens slightly. I just use my Instant Pot.  
2\. The next day - prepare the sauce. Set aside.  
3\. Slice onions and red bell peppers. Cut French string beans into one-inch
pieces. Chop broccoli into florets.  
4\. Using a mortar & pestle, smash the garlic and Indian green chilies (or
Thai red chilies).  
5\. This is what you have.  

### Cook Thai Basil Fried Rice

1\. Heat up a wok medium-high heat. Once hot, add oil.  
2\. Add garlic and green chilies. Saute for 30 seconds or so.  
3\. Add sliced onions. Saute for a minute.  
4\. Add green beans, red bell pepper, and broccoli. Saute for a minute.  

5\. Now add the rice and pour the sauce all over.  
6\. Gently stir fry the rice for a couple of minutes so it heats up.  
7\. Add the Thai basil and stir. Turn off the stove right after.  

### Optional Eggs

8\. If you choose to add egg, you can add it now. Push the rice to the side.
Add a teaspoon of oil.  
9\. Add eggs.  
10\. Cook scrambled eggs.  
11\. Once the eggs are scrambled, mix it into the rice. Turn off the stove.

This recipe was so good. I didn‚Äôt have all the ingredients, so I use used 1/2
tbsp granulated sugar, omitted the fish sauce and broccoli. I added some
shredded carrots, used eggs for proteins, and sesame oil instead of avo oil. I
will definitely be making this again!!!
