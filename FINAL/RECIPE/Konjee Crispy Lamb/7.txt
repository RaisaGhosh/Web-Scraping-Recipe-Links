Lamb chops with new potatoes and green beans

This is a **list of lamb and mutton dishes and foods**. Lamb and mutton are
terms for the meat of domestic sheep (species _Ovis aries_ ) at different
ages. A sheep in its first year is called a lamb, and its meat is also called
lamb. The meat of a juvenile sheep older than one year is hogget; outside
North America this is also a term for the living animal.[1] The meat of an
adult sheep is mutton, a term only used for the meat, not the living animal.

Meat from sheep features prominently in several cuisines of the Mediterranean.
Lamb and mutton are very popular in Central Asia and in India, where other red
meats may be eschewed for religious or economic reasons. It is also very
popular in Australia. Barbecued mutton is also a specialty in some areas of
the United States (chiefly Owensboro, Kentucky) and Canada.
