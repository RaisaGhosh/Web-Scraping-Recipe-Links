# Crispy Lamb With Szechuan Sauce

Mutton

oi-Anwesha

By **Anwesha Barari**

on January 30, 2012

Crispy lamb is a pretty popular appetizer we order in Chinese restaurants but
rarely does it occur to us that this easy Chinese food recipe can be made at
home too. The Szechuan sauce in this mutton recipe is the main ingredient. You
can obviously buy Szechuan sauce off the shelf in stores but to make it
yourself at home gives a more authentic taste to this Chinese food recipe.

To make crispy lamb you need some basic Chinese spices that are most often
used in oriental cuisine. This Chinese food recipe is not technically
challenging like dumplings. It is easy to prepare this mutton recipe using
Chinese spices if you have a basic idea of how Szechuan sauce should taste.

**Ingredients For Crispy Lamb:**

1\. Boneless lamb 300 grams (shredded roughly)  
2\. Corn Flour 1 cup  
3\. Green Chillies 3-4 minced  
4\. Ground Black pepper 1 tablespoon  
5\. Dry Red Chillies 5 (chopped finely)  
6\. Garlic 6 cloves (minced)  
7\. Ginger 2 inch piece (minced)  
8\. Red chilli powder 1 teaspoon  
9\. Bamboo shoots 4-5 (chopped)  
10\. Green Bell Peppers or capsicums 1 (cut into long strips)  
11\. Soy Sauce 3 tablespoons  
12\. Oyster Sauce 1 tablespoon  
13\. Cooking Sherry 2 tablespoons  
14\. Salt as per taste  
15\. Oil half a pan for deep frying

**Procedure For Crispy Lamb:**

  * When you shred the meat, it should not turn to minced meat. Shred it through a wide grater or cut thing strips with a knife. Choose the less fatty potions of meat.
  * Mix cornflour with chopped green chillies, a dash of salt and pepper. Put the meat in it as you heat oil in a deep pan for frying.
  * Deep fry the meat until it turns golden brown on medium flame. Strain the oil and soak up the rest with tissues. Keep it aside
  * Take another pan and heat 2 tablespoons of oil it it. Add the red chillies first and wait till it fries well. You'll know from the strong smell that will make you sneeze.
  * Turn the flame to minimum and saute the garlic and ginger for 2 minutes until it cooks properly. Now add red chilli powder, the bamboo shoots and bell peppers to it.
  * Cover and cook for another 2 minutes before adding the sauces and cooking sherry to it. Steam it up for another 2 minutes and add the fried meat.
  * Stir it in slowly and add just add a cup of water to it and salt. Let it bubble up and soak the water for 3-4 minutes. Then add 1 tablespoon cornflour to thicken the sauce.

You can serve crispy lamp garnished with chopped onions and parsley
