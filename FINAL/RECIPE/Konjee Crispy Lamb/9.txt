Live and let live. He truly brings 'Joy' to the world merely being how he is.

**You are a genuine foodie and among the few men who can also cook, how did
this happen?**  
It's thanks to my wanderlust. I cook when I travel. Never in India and never
Indian. If you tell me to cook a biryani or a tadka dal, I can't, though I
love to eat good Indian khana. But when abroad I eat only local food, even if
out for a month.

**Why do you cook only when abroad?**  
Simple, there I go shopping for ingredients. I love to poke my nose in
everything local. It's fun, I am in a different frame of mind; relaxed, far
from my work, I am on holiday, and food is foremost on my mind. And wine, of
course.

**I believe you always opt for hotels which offer kitchenette service, tell me
about your culinary trysts.** **?**  
Right, it's always so. Or even service apartments. Okay, in France out in the
market, once I saw rabbit being sold. I had to get it. In my mind I conjured
the taste I wanted and accordingly picked out the herbs, came to the hotel,
cooked it and voila, it was magnifique!

**No recipe, no nothing, just your mood prompts you?**  
Absolutely. I don't google to find out how to cook. I follow my instinct, all
the years of dining experiences the world over come to the fore. My taste buds
never let me down. You see, I enjoy it fully.

**Better than going to restaurants?**  
I do that too. But restaurants abroad take last orders too early in the night.
I don't like to be pushed. I enjoy my wine, like to eat and drink at my pace.
So there is nothing like Naaz and I sitting on our own patio, talking, pouring
wine, nice and slow and easy, me going and checking the cooking from time to
time and then savouring our dinner.

**Any memorable meals not cooked by you …?**  
Has to be in Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia where I went diving. The fish swim in
deep reef waters and develop unbelievable taste; Sea Bass, Grouper was
fantastic. We had our lobster raw, with just some wasabi salt and a dash of
soy sauce, unforgettable. Another one in France, where they served a piece of
steak - rare, upon a perfectly cooked foie gras. They do such things only in
France.

**You don 't shy from eating unusual foods, do you?**  
Right, from sea beetles in Argentina, to snake blood in Taiwan, and in Spain,
meat from a bull killed at a bull fight. Yes, I seem to have been adventurous.
But that's part of travel, you must!

**And which are the unforgettable destinations?**  
Corsica island, amazing beauty, also Sardinia. Bruges in Belgium for its
Michelin-starred restaurants. Bariloche in Argentina for what they do with
chocolates. Zanzibar for pure, unadulterated fun, Puerto Rico, for the local
food. Jordan, for Arab food served Bohri-style, in community thals.

**Favourite cuisine?**  
Chinese wins. And Goldren Dragon tops. It's been consistently good for years.
Take this Konjee Lamb for example, it tastes the same over decades. Always
perfect!
