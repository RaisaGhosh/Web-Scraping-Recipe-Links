_**This Meatball Soup recipe has a savory tomato broth with Italian
seasonings, pasta noodles, spinach, and bell peppers. Top each serving bowl
with a dollop of ricotta cheese and some Parmesan and you have a restaurant
quality meal that your family will love!**_

## Meatball Soup

I know that the ingredient list is a little bit long here, but this recipe has
the best combination of flavors. My family (picky 5-year old included), loves
this recipe. Adding a dollop of Ricotta cheese prior to serving really takes
it to the next level.

**PRO TIP:** If you have the rind from a block of Parmesan or Romano cheese,
add it to the soup while it simmers for next level flavor!

## What Makes It Different

**The meatballs start out with a panade** , which is a starch (breadcrumbs)
and a liquid (heavy cream) combined together to form a paste which is gently
worked into the meat to keep it extra juicy and flavorful during the cooking
process.

**The broth is a combination of chicken broth, beef broth, and blended
tomatoes with a perfect seasoning blend.** **Onions are caramelized slightly**
in the beginning so that their natural sugars can offset the acidity from the
tomatoes.

**Diced peppers and spinach** add some veggies to the mix and the pasta is can
be cooked right in the soup or on the side.

## How to Make It

_See recipe card below this post for ingredient quantities and full
instructions._

**Combine meatball ingredients and roll into 1-inch meatballs. Sauté in olive
oil in batches for 2-3 minutes. Remove and set aside.**

**Melt butter in the same pot and add onions. Let them cook slowly over
medium-low heat for 10 minutes to caramelize them slightly. Add the bell
peppers and cook for 4 minutes.**

**Add the garlic, tomato paste, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and
seasonings. Cook for 1 minute. Add the chicken/beef broth and blended
tomatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer. Simmer uncovered for 15
minutes, or longer to further concentrate the flavor and thicken the soup.
Stir occasionally.**

**Add the meatballs and pasta and bring to a gentle boil. Cook pasta to al
dente. Stir in the heavy cream and add the spinach. Add to serving bowls and
serve with Ricotta and Parmesan cheese.**

> ## Pro Tips
>
>   * **Frozen Meatballs can be used instead of making your own.  **
>   * **Add the rind of a block of Parmesan or Romano cheese** for added
> flavor while the soup simmers.
>   * **28 oz. crushed tomatoes** can be used instead of diced.
>   * **If you plan on having leftovers,** you may want to boil the noodles
> separately and add them directly to serving bowls as the noodles will
> continue to absorb broth during storage.
>   * **The hot sauce doesn’t make the soup hot and you can’t taste the
> mustard powder or Worcestershire sauce.** These are all flavor enhancers in
> this soup.
>   * **All chicken broth can be used** instead of a combination of chicken
> and beef if needed or preferred.
>   * **Milk can be used instead of heavy cream for the meatballs** if
> preferred.
>

## Storage

  * Store in an airtight container and **refrigerate for up to 3 days** or **freeze for up to 3 months.**
  * **If freezing:** I recommend that you boil the pasta separately and add it directly to serving bowls. Freeze the soup without the pasta so that it doesn't absorb all of the broth and/or get mushy. Boil fresh pasta prior to serving. 

> ## Tools For This Recipe
>
> _(Amazon affiliate links)- Check out all of my **kitchen essentials here.**_
>
>   * 4.5 quart Dutch oven- A great size for this (and most) soup recipes.
>   * Box Cheese Grater- Shredding from a block tastes and melts much better
> than packaged cheese.
>   * Pinch Bowls- for measuring out ingredients ahead of time.

This Meatball Soup Recipe is has a flavorful tomato-based broth with Italian
seasonings, pasta noodles, spinach, and bell peppers. Your family will love it
with a dollop of Ricotta and some parmesan cheese!

### Ingredients

  * ▢ 1 Tablespoon olive oil

#### Meatballs

  * ▢ 1 egg, beaten
  * ▢ ½ cup heavy cream, can sub milk
  * ▢ 1/2 cup Italian breadcrumbs
  * ▢ ¼ cup Parmesan cheese, finely grated into a powder
  * ▢ 3 cloves garlic, finely diced
  * ▢ 1 teaspoon salt
  * ▢ ½ teaspoon pepper
  * ▢ ½ lb. ground beef, 80% lean
  * ▢ ½ lb. ground pork

#### Soup

  * ▢ 1 tablespoon butter
  * ▢ 1 yellow onion, diced
  * ▢ ½ cup bell pepper, diced
  * ▢ 3 cloves garlic, minced
  * ▢ 2 tablespoons tomato paste
  * ▢ 3 cups chicken broth
  * ▢ 1 ½ cups beef broth, can sub chicken broth
  * ▢ 2 (14.5 oz.) cans diced tomatoes, undrained
  * ▢ 1 teaspoon hot sauce, optional
  * ▢ 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
  * ▢ ½ cup heavy cream
  * ▢ 2 cups spinach
  * ▢ 1 cup dry pasta, I used cavatappi

#### Seasonings

  * ▢ 1 teaspoon dried oregano
  * ▢ 1 teaspoon dried basil
  * ▢ 1 teaspoon dried parsley
  * ▢ 1 teaspoon mustard powder
  * ▢ 1 pinch red pepper flakes
  * ▢ Salt/Pepper, to taste

#### For Serving

  * ▢ 8 oz. Ricotta Cheese
  * ▢ ½ cup Parmesan Cheese
  * ▢ Red Pepper Flakes

### Instructions

#### For the Meatballs

  * Combine the whisked egg and heavy cream in a large bowl. Add the breadcrumbs and stir for 1-2 minutes to form a paste. This is called a “panade” and will make the meatballs super flavorful and tender. Add Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Add the ground beef and ground pork and gently combine, don’t overwork the meat, we want tender meatballs.

  * Roll the meat into 1-inch balls.

  * Heat the olive oil in a 4 ½ quart soup pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

  * Brown the meatballs in batches for 2-3 minutes, add a splash of olive oil throughout cooking and decrease heat slightly as needed. The inside of the meatballs will finish cooking in the soup.

  * Remove the meatballs and set aside.

#### For the Soup

  * Place the diced tomatoes in a large bowl and use an immersion blender to blend it to your desired texture, chunks of tomato can be left if preferred. (Alternatively, you can also use a blender.) Set aside.

  * Melt the butter in the same soup pot over medium-low heat. Add the diced onions and cook for 10 minutes, a little longer than normal as this will release some of their sugar which counteracts the acidity of the tomatoes. Stir every few minutes.

  * Add the peppers and cook for 4 minutes. Add the garlic, tomato paste, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and seasonings. Cook for 1 minute.

  * Add in the chicken broth, beef broth, and tomatoes.

  * Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Let it simmer uncovered for 15 minutes. You can also simmer it longer to contrate the flavor and thicken it more.

  * Stir the soup and bring the soup to a gentle boil. Add the meatballs and the pasta and return it to a gentle boil. Cook until pasta is cooked through, refer to package for cooking time. It may take a little longer since we’re boiling gently. Test-taste a noodle before serving.

  * Reduce heat to low and stir in heavy cream, then add the spinach and cook until wilted, about 1 minute.

  * Transfer to serving bowls and top with ricotta cheese, Parmesan, and red pepper flakes. (You can warm the ricotta in the microwave first if preferred.)

### Notes

  * Since the onions take a little while to caramelize, that’s a good time to measure out the seasonings and additional ingredients for the soup.
  * **Frozen Meatballs** can be used instead of making your own.
  * **Add the rind of a block of Parmesan or Romano cheese** for added flavor while the soup simmers.
  * **28 oz. crushed tomatoes** can be used instead of diced.
  * **If you plan on having leftovers:** Consider boiling the noodles separately and adding them directly to serving bowls as the noodles will continue to absorb broth during storage.
  * **This makes approximately 45 1-inch meatballs**
  * **The hot sauce doesn’t make the soup hot and you can’t taste the mustard powder or Worcestershire sauce.** These are all flavor enhancers in this soup.
  * Nutritional facts don't include the Ricotta/Parmesan for serving

I made this soup today and it was well worth it! The meatballs took the most
time but I didn't want to use frozen. The spinach and cheeses were the perfect
touch!! Thanks again Cozy Cook!!!

You're very welcome Kelly! Sounds like you put some extra love into the
meatballs, nice work! Thanks so much for the great comments!💗

This is now one of my top favorite recipes! It was SO good and came out
perfectly. Highly recommend adding the ricotta and red paper flakes. I looked
at my husband and was like “do we even need it”? And he said are you freaking
kidding?! You better add that. So glad I did!! It was just that extra touch it
needed like you said advised. So so SO fabulous.

lol, I like the way your husband thinks lol! I'm so happy this was such a hit,
thanks so much Therese for taking the time to leave such great comments!❤️

This soup is so good. I am always looking for new soup recipes and this one
was a big hit. I added a little more spice to it as my family likes spicy
foods, but otherwise I give it 5 stars!!!

    * **Stephanie** -- June 27, 2022 @ 9:50 am  Reply

Thanks so much for the great review Laura, it's much appreciated! I'm so happy
you enjoyed it!💗

I switched one of the diced cans of tomato for a diced can with garlic oregano
and basil. Adds more flavor and recommend adding the rhynes of Parmesan.

Thanks for taking the time to comment Chris!😃

  5. **Johanna** -- May 3, 2022 @ 5:29 pm  Reply

I had to use what I had on hand, specifically frozen beef meatballs, no pasta
or spinach and my chicken broth was spicy, added some fennel seed, my tomatoes
were fire-roasted and I put in some leftover marinara, but followed everything
else. It's delish, came together quickly, and is now a nice Keto soup for the
next couple of days. Although I didn't follow the recipe to a T, this was a
great jumping-off point to use up some pantry staples. Thanks for the recipe.

Can you tell me if the calories are per cup or what your serving size is?

Hey Bethany! It’s per cup! ☺️

  7. **Aliya** -- April 6, 2022 @ 8:18 am  Reply

This was phenomenal! The smell of the spices while it was cooking made the
whole house happy. In addition to caramelizing the onions I also added a
little sugar to the tomatoes when they seemed too acidic. Great winter recipe
that will be on heavy rotation. Thank you.

    * **Stephanie** -- April 6, 2022 @ 9:19 am  Reply

That smell is my favorite part! I'm so happy you enjoyed this one Aliya,
thanks so much for the great review!❤️

  8. **Betty Sanford** -- March 16, 2022 @ 9:30 pm  Reply

This soup was amazing! I did use Italian pork sausage for the pork and it was
delicious. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. My whole family
loved it. We were going to the beach for spring break, so I made the liquid
and froze it and made the meatballs, browned them, and froze them. When we got
to the beach it was so easy to add the cream and spinach. Highly recommend
it!!!

    * **Stephanie** -- March 17, 2022 @ 10:19 am  Reply

I love that you brought these to the beach, so fun! I'm assuming you're not to
close to me in NH lol. Thanks so much for the great comments and review!😀

The note on the mustard powder and Worcestershire sauce was spot on— do not
leave them out! Thanks for the great recipe, Cozy Cook!

    * **Stephanie** -- March 12, 2022 @ 3:09 pm  Reply

Hi Corie! I LOVE that you trusted that info- it makes such a nice difference
with those flavor enhancers! 😉 Thank you for encouraging others to follow that
tip and for taking the time to leave a review, I really appreciate it!

Great flavor! I desperately need to go grocery shopping but made this last
night as I had most everything on hand. I used a pack of ground turkey and it
worked great. Thanks for the recipe.

    * **Stephanie** -- March 11, 2022 @ 1:45 pm  Reply

Hi MC! I'm so happy to hear that you loved the soup, thank you so much for
taking the time to come back and leave a review, I really appreciate it!! 🙂
