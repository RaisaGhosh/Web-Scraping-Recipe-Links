By **9Honey | Kitchen**

  * Difficulty  
 **easy**

  * Cooking time  
 **less than 30 minutes**

  * Serves  
 **serves 4**

##  Ingredients  Method

  * 1½ cups jasmine rice

  * 3 cups water

  * 2 tbsp sunflower oil

  * 500g peeled green prawn, tails on

  * 250g sugar snap peas, trimmed

  * 2 large garlic cloves, crushed

  * 3 tbsp sweet chilli sauce

  * 2 tbsp fish sauce

  * 2 tbsp light soy sauce

  * 1/3 cold water

  * ½ cup fresh Thai basil leaves

##  Ingredients  Method

1\. **Cook rice** Use absorption method: wash rice thoroughly until water runs
clear. Place rice and water in saucepan and bring slowly to boil. Cover and
simmer gently over low heat for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and leave
undisturbed for 10 minutes before serving.  
  
2\. Meanwhile, heat oil in wok (or frying pan) over medium heat. Stir-fry
prawns for 2 minutes. Add sugar snaps and stir-fry for further 1 minute. Using
slotted spoon, remove prawns and sugar snaps from pan and put on plate.  
  
3\. Reduce heat and add garlic to pan. Fry for 10 seconds, then add sweet
chilli, fish sauce, soy sauce and 1⁄3 cup cold water. Bring to boil and simmer
for 2 to 3 minutes until thickened. Return prawns and snap peas to pan and
heat through for 1 minute. Sprinkle over basil leaves and serve with rice.  
Don't overcook your prawns as they'll end up tough and chewy.
