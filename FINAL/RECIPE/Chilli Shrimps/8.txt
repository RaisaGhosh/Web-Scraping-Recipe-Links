### Garlic Chili Shrimp with smoked paprika

##### _Also known as Gambas al Ajillo_

Traditionally, Gambas al Ajillo or Spanish garlic prawns or shrimp are so
simple to make. Made with only three ingredients, shrimps, garlic, and olive
oil. This recipe is inspired from that, and brought to a higher level, with
the addition of smoked paprika, chili, wine and butter for that richness and
smoothness.

Try and buy the best ingredients you can, fresh shrimp is always best, but
frozen works well too. When deveining them, cut all the way from the tail to
the top so they open nicely while cooking. Make sure you use high heat for
that beautiful caramelisation. But don’t over cook them, keep them translucent
inside, they will finish cooking when you throw them back in the sauce. So
many recipes over cook the shrimp as they don’t set them aside first. This is
such an important step, so don’t miss it.

Buy the authentic Spanish smoked paprika if you can, the fragrance is so much
nicer than regular ones and of course, use high quality extra virgin olive
oil.

When cooking the garlic, only let it brown slightly, otherwise it will burn.
You want that roasted garlic flavour so brown it just a little.

When adding the butter to the sauce, do it fast over very low heat, it will
emulsify into a glossy incredible sauce. Avoid too much heat as it can break
and become oily. Serve it with crusty bread or saffron rice.

#### __Ingredients

  * __12 large shrimps
  *  __2-3 cloves of garlic
  *  __1 tsp chili flakes (less if really hot)
  *  __¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
  *  __½ cup dry white wine
  *  __1½ tsp Smoked paprika
  *  __4 tbsp – 60g soft cubed butter
  *  __4 parsley sprigs
  *  __½ Lemon squeeze
  *  __Crusty bread slices
  *  __Salt

#### __Steps

  * __Step 1

Devein the shrimps and rinse well.

  * __Step 2

Peel the garlic and chop finely. Finely chop the parsley, set aside.

  * __Step 3

In a medium size pan over medium high heat,  
add olive oil. Once the olive oil is shimmering and hot,  
add the shrimps. Cook about 45 seconds on each side until shrimp browned but
still translucent inside. Don’t over cook them. Set aside in warm place.

  * __Step 4

To the same pan back on medium heat, add a drizzle of olive oil, the garlic
and chili. Cook until the garlic begins to barely brown, add the smoked
paprika, mix well then, deglaze with the white wine. Reduce by half. Add the
squeeze of half a lemon.

  * __Step 5

Return the shrimp to the sauce. Add a little salt, the chopped parsley mix and
toss well over high heat for approx. 20 seconds. Place and arrange shrimp in
warm serving dish. Return the pan to heat and turn to very low. Throw in the
butter cubes a few at a time and mix well until all are melted, and the sauce
has emulsified.

  * __Step 6

Pour sauce over shrimp and garnish with parsley.  
Enjoy with a beverage of your choice. I recommend a crisp chilled dry white
wine such as Sauvignon blanc, Pinot gris, Riesling or Chardonnay.
