# Chili Shrimp Recipe

Jump to Recipe Print Recipe

Chili Shrimp is a delicious shrimp dish that is best eaten with steamed white
rice. This dish is very tasty, so expect to consume more rice.

This Chili Shrimp Recipe is adapted from our Chili Crab recipe. While almost
the same ingredients were utilized, I tried to tweak this dish a bit so that
it can have its own disposition. I suggest that you use shrimp with head and
scales on because these are more flavorful compared to the cleaned (scales and
head removed) ones.

It will also be nice if you have a sour soup to accompany chili shrimp.
Sinigang na Bangus always works for me.

Try this Chili Shrimp Recipe. Let me know what you think.
