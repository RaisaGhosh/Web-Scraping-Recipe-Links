I tried this recipe and it was really tasty although I used cider vinegar and
omitted the black bean sauce. I made iranian basmati rice to accompagne it and
they both tasted really nice.

Great taste. Easy recipe to alter according to what was on hand.<br/>Omitted
the bean paste, added more chilli and used cider vinegar.<br/>Matt made it for
dinner last night & if I hadn't seen him put the tomato sauce in the pan I
never would've guessed it was in there. I think he used less than stated due
to others reviews.<br/>Thanks for sharing, mate :)

Great recipe! I make shrimp stock with the shells for cooking the jasmine
rice. I also use Toban Djan instead of Black Bean Paste
