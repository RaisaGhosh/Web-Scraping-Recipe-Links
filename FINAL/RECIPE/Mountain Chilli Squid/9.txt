# Saltbush & Mountain Pepper Cuttlefish with Micro Herb Mayonnaise

This is my take on the classic salt and pepper squid but utilising incredible
local and Indigenous produce to make it a little special. Cuttlefish is an
amazing alternative to squid and if you can find it in your local fishmonger
(or on a menu) give it a try, it is sweet, tender, and delicious.

 **Prep: 15 minutes - Cook: 5 minutes - Serves: 6 part of a shared meal -
Difficulty: Easy - Recipe: Hayden Quinn**

### Ingredients

750g cuttlefish, cleaned*, opened flat  
1 teaspoon dried and ground saltbush*  
1 teaspoon ground Tasmanian Pepper Berry*  
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil  
1 lemon, sliced into wedges, to serve  

 _Micro Herb Mayonnaise  
_ ½ cup full-fat mayonnaise  
½ lemon, juiced  
¼ cup micro herbs, like chervil or fennel *  
½ teaspoon sea salt  
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  

 _Herb Salad_  
2 cups mixed micro herbs*  
Sea salt + pepper, to taste  
Lemon juice + olive oil, to dress

**Notes  
** * You can find Australian bush spices from speciality stores such as Kungas
Can Cook, Essential Ingredient, Herbies or search online.  
* Ask you fishmonger to clean and cut your calamari / cuttlefish / squid for you. It’s much cleaner!   
* If you do not have access to micro herbs (check out our friends at Urban Green) you can use your regular herbs as replacements



### Method

 **Step 1.** Preheat BBQ grill to high. Clean the cuttlefish bodies* and slice
to open so they are one large flat piece. Add to a bowl with the olive oil,
salt bush and mountain pepper. Toss to coat well. Allow to sit for a few
minutes while making the Micro Herb Mayonnaise.

  **Step 2.** Add the mayonnaise to a small bowl. Add in the lemon juice,
    micro herbs, salt, and pepper and stir to combine.

  **Step 3.** Place the calamari onto the BBQ grill over super high heat and
    cook for 1-2 minutes until just cooked and slightly charred.

  **Step 4.** Toss together the herbs for your herb salad and season well with
    salt and pepper and dress with lemon juice and olive oil.

  **Step 5.** Serve the Saltbush + Mountain Pepper Cuttlefish with the Micro
    Herb Mayonnaise. Squeezing over the lemon juice and garnishing with the
    micro herb salad..
