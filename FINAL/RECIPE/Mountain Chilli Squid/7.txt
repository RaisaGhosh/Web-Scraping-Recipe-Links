    * To make the chilli sauce; combine all the sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Simmer over high heat for approximately 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half. Set aside until required. 

    * Prepare the barbecue for direct cooking over high heat (230°C to 290°C). 

    * Using a mortar and pestle, separately crush the Sichuan and black peppercorns, and then add to a small bowl. Add the remaining seasoning ingredients to the small bowl, stir to combine. 

    * To prepare the squid; cut each squid hood in half lengthways. Score the inside of the flesh in a cross-hatch pattern. Cut the squid into 1.5cm strips. Pat dry with paper towel and add to a large bowl. Add the olive oil to the squid and toss to coat. Then coat the squid with the seasoning, adding the seasoning gradually while tossing, to evenly coat the squid. 

    * Once the barbecue has preheated, brush the cooking grills clean. Place the squid onto the cooking grill, ensuring the pieces are not overlapping. Grill the squid over **direct high heat** for 1 minute, or until golden. Flip the squid over and grill for a further 30 seconds, or until cooked through. 

Once the barbecue has preheated, brush the cooking grills clean. Place the
squid onto the cooking grill, ensuring the pieces are not overlapping. Grill
the squid over **high heat** for 1 minute, or until golden. Flip the squid
over and grill for a further 30 seconds, or until cooked through.

    * Serve the squid immediately with the chilli sauce and lime wedges. **Tips:** Sichuan peppercorns can be found at large supermarkets or Asian grocers. If you like peppery heat, add an extra ½ teaspoon of Sichuan and ½ teaspoon of black peppercorns. It is important that your cooking grill is preheated, hot and cleaned for best results.  
If the squid has turned golden but is sticking a little, use a metal spatula
to ease it off the cooking grill.
