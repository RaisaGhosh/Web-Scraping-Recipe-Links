#### Ingredients

1kg squid cleaned and cut into strips  
2 cups cornflour  
2 cups self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting  
4 cups chilled soda water  
2 tsp freshly ground mountain pepper  
1 tsp dried salt bush  
1 tsp sea salt  
vegetable oil for deep-frying  
â  
TO SERVE: fresh lemon and aioli

#### Method

1 Place the corn flour and self-raising flour in a large bowl, and slowly
whisk in the soda water. Set aside for 10 minutes.

2 Place the pepper, salt bush and salt in a small bowl and mix to combine. Set
aside.

3Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until the temperature reaches
180Â°C on a deep-frying thermometer. Place some extra self raising flour in a
bowl. Dust the squid in the extra flour until lightly coated, then dip into
the batter, shaking off any excess before frying.

4Deep-fry for 2-3 minutes or until golden and crisp. While still hot, toss
with salt and pepper mixture to coat. Serve with fresh lemon and aioli.

#### Wine Match

##### 2021 Four Winds Sparkling Riesling, Canberra District, A$27

Riesling, riesling, riesling, first for the squid, second for the tempura
batter and third for the salt and peppery spices. Itâs the floral aromatics
and refreshing acidity of a good riesling that lends itself to this recipe â
and the latest Four Winds is a beauty. After the smoke ruined the Canberra
District 2020 vintage, itâs good to see things bounce back in 2021. Buy two
bottles, the first wonât touch the sides.
