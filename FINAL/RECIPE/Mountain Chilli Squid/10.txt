# Sweet Chilli Squid With Rocket

September 7, 2014/0 Comments/in Diabetes Recipes, Dinner, Lunch, Mountain
Bread Recipes, Snacks, Yeast Free Diet/by Laura Tulloch

**Crunchy snow peas and crispy Mountain Bread cases are the support acts for
this delicious soft squid with a sweet chilli-lime bite.**

## INGREDIENTS

4 tubes of squid, cleaned  
1 clove garlic, crushed  
½ lemon, juiced  
2 tablespoons sweet chilli jam  
pinch of salt  
2 teaspoons vegetable oil  
50 gm snow pea shoots  
10 snow peas, top and tailed  
4 sheets of Mountain Bread™

## DIRECTIONS

Makes 12-15

Prep time: 30 minutes. Marinate the squid ahead of time for at least an hour.  
Cooking time: 15 minutes

Cut tubes of squid lengthways in half. Score with a knife to make a criss
cross pattern. Place into a bowl with garlic, lemon juice, chilli jam and
salt. Marinate for a minimum of 1 hour.

Use a bread and butter plate to cut rounds of Mountain Bread™. Press firmly
into ramekins or large muffin tins. Bake in moderate oven (180C) for 10
minutes or till crisp to touch. Remove from oven and allow to cool.

Heat oil in a pan until very hot. Quickly sear one side of the squid for 30-40
seconds, turn and repeat on the other side, remove and set aside.

In the same pan add the snow peas, cook for 1 minute tossing frequently,
remove and set aside. Heat the marinade in the pan and add salt and pepper.
Allow to cool and use this for a dressing.

Combine squid, snow pea shoots, snow peas and dressing. Place Mountain Bread™
cup on a plate and fill with the squid salad and serve.
