# Mountain Pepper Leaf Squid

Recipes / Mountain Pepper Leaf Squid

**Prep time: 5 mins  
Cook time: 10 mins  
Serves: 4**

A bush tucker twist on familiar pub fare! Mountain Pepper Leaf adds a spicy,
earthy flavour to this dish and it's high in antioxidants, which have been
linked to the prevention and delay of Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune and
cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. And who could forget Lemon Myrtle
with a squid dish!



Ingredients

**Calamari:**

  * 4 squid/calamari hoods
  * 1 tsp Lemon Myrtle
  * 1 cup tempura flour
  * 20ml macadamia oil
  * 50g butter
  * 1 tsp Old Man Saltbush
  * 1 tsp Mountain Pepper Leaf
  * 1 tsp chilli flakes

A bush tucker twist on familiar pub fare! Mountain Pepper Leaf adds a spicy,
earthy flavour to this dish and it's high in antioxidants, which have been
linked to the prevention and delay of Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune and
cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. And who could forget Lemon Myrtle
with a squid dish!



Method

  1. Prepare calamari hoods by washing and removing the 'backbone" and skin. Cut the hoods into triangles or squares.
  2. In a bowl, mix the Lemon Myrtle and flour. Roll the calamari pieces through the flour mixture.
  3. Heat macadamia oil and butter in a wok. Add Old Man Saltbush, Mountain Pepper Leaf and chilli.  
Simmer for 30 seconds. Add the calamari, in batches, and cook until they curl.
Using a slotted spoon, remove from the oil and drain on paper towel. Repeat
with the remaining calamari.
