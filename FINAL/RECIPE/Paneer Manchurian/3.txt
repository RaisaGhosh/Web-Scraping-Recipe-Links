 **Dry and spicy Paneer Manchurian** is one of the best Indo Chinese recipes.
This recipe is similar to gobi manchurian but uses soft paneer cubes instead
of cauliflower florets. It is one of the easy paneer dishes of Indo Chinese
cuisine and an ideal party food as well.

Paneer Manchurian Recipe In Hindi (हिन्दी में पढ़े)

Paneer Manchurian Recipe In Gujarati (ગુજરાતી માં વાંચો)

Ingredients:  
---  
250 gms (1/2 lbs) Paneer (cottage cheese)  
2 tablespoons Maida (all purpose flour)  
4 tablespoons Cornflour (corn starch)  
1/2 teaspoon Garlic Paste  
1/2 teaspoon Ginger Paste  
Cooking Oil  
Salt  
1/4 cup Water  
For Sauté  
1/2 teaspoon Garlic Paste  
1/2 teaspoon Ginger Paste  
1/4 cup finely chopped Capsicum  
1 small Onion, finely chopped  
1 Green Chilli, finely chopped  
2 tablespoons finely chopped Spring Onion  
2 tablespoons Cooking Oil  
1 tablespoons Soy Sauce  
1/2 tablespoon Chilli Sauce  
2 tablespoons Tomato Ketchup  
Salt  
  
Directions for Manchurian:

  1. Cut paneer (cottage cheese) into small cubes. Mix maida flour, cornflour, salt, ginger paste and garlic paste with 1/4 cup water in a bowl and make a thick batter. Add paneer cubes in prepared batter, mix and let them marinate for 20 minutes.

  2. Heat oil in kadai (pan). Deep fry marinated, batter coated paneer cubes over medium flame until they turn golden brown.

  3. Drain and transfer them to plate having absorbent kitchen paper spread on it (to remove excess oil).

Directions for Sauté:

  1. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wide, thin-bottomed pan on medium flame. Add ginger paste, garlic paste and sauté for 30 seconds on medium flame.

  2. Add chopped green chilli, diced capsicum and diced onion. Sauté for 2-3 minutes.

  3. Add soy sauce, tomato ketchup, chilli sauce and salt. Add fried paneer pieces and spring onion; mix well. Toss everything multiple times and cook for 1-2 minutes on high flame.

  4. Paneer manchurian dry is ready. Garnish with chopped spring onion and serve.

Tips and Variations:

  * Chilli sauce and soy sauce are main flavoring ingredients in any manchurian recipe. You can adjust the quantity of these two sauces to get a desired flavor.
  * Prepared batter should not be too thick or too thin. Thin batter will not coat paneer cubes well and thick batter will not make crisp outer layer.
  * If you are staying at a place where paneer is not available in store, then either you can make it at home or use tofu.

Taste: Soft and spicy with nice complex flavor of soya sauce, ginger and
garlic.

Serving Ideas: Serve it as a starter or as an evening snack with tomato ketch
up and chilli sauce.

I made this. It is so easy and tasty. Can you please tell me that adding of
chilly sauce is must?  

 **Response:** Hi Megala, chilli sauce is added to get the spiciness. If it is
not available, increase the quantity of green chili (if you want spiciness)
and add a teaspoon of vinegar to get the flavor.

Jun 20, 2015 by Divya

I made it, but I did not get the crisp coating.  
Instead it was soft and gooey. Can you please tell me why this happened?  

 **Response:** Hi Divya, sorry for the late reply. To make the outer layer
crispy, follow the below given guidelines.  
  
1.While making batter, do not decrease the amount of corn flour/corn starch
(not corn meal) or substitute it with any other flour in the recipe.  
2.Batter should have medium thick consistency like dosa batter (not too thin
or not too thick).  
3.Deep fry coated paneer cubes over medium flame or shallow fry them in a non-
stick pan until crispy.

Superb. I love it. Really yummy.  

Nov 30, 2014 by Satish Sharma

Very good recipe. However, I have one question, the batter, which we prepared
with corn flour and maida is very sticky and adhesive like paste. It is very
difficult to take paneer cubes out of it. What is the solution for this
problem?  

 **Response:** Hi Satish,  
It is normal if batter turns sticky like paste, it happens because of the corn
flour. Whenever you mix corn flour with water and keep it idle for long
duration, it will turn sticky. To overcome with this problem, just stir the
batter with a spoon and it will turn normal within a minute.  
In this recipe, you can skip marinating the paneer cubes in step-1. Just
prepare the batter, dip each cube in it and deep fry.

Hi everyone,  
Very nice recipe, thanks to this website. I am going to prepare it on my
brother's birthday. My friend asked about this recipe. Can I ask you
something?  
Can I use coriander or something else in the place of spring onions? I am
allergic to soy, what else can I use instead of it?  
Please answer me. Once again, it is an excellent and great recipe.  

 **Response:** Hi Purvithahi, if spring onion is not available, you can skip
it, but you cannot use coriander leaves in place of it. You can’t replace soy
sauce with any other sauce in the recipe. If you are allergic to soy, make the
manchurian without adding soy sauce, it will also taste good.

Hi ,  
  
I need to try out this recipe after this Sunday for a a very special day, this
sounds yummy and tasty. Can you let me know the measurement for around 8
servings. I am a new bee in the kitchen section. Please help.  

 **Response:** Hi Prameela, if you are new to the kitchen section, I will
suggest you to once try the recipe before making it in large quantity so you
can get idea of quantity and you can easily make this for 8 people on special
day. This recipe can be served as starter (for 3-4 people) and as side dish
(for 2 people). However, the quantity required to serve depends on the people
(to whom you gonna serve - kids or young), in which course (side dish,
starter, main dish), etc.
