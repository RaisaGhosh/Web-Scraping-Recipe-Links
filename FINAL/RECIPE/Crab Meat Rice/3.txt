## ingredients

Nutrition

  * 1⁄2 lb coarsely-chopped imitation crabmeat (the spices in this dish will over power the delicate taste of real crab, but you can still use if yo)
  * 1  lb shrimp (peeled and deveined and coarsely chopped)
  * 1⁄2 lb baby shrimp
  * 1  medium onion, chopped 
  * 1  small chopped bell pepper (any color)

  * salt and pepper
  * Old Bay Seasoning (don't substitute)
  * olive oil

## directions

  * Prepare Spanish rice mix per the package instructions omitting the tomatoes.
  * While rice cooks, sauté onions and bell peppers in a small amount of olive oil until soft and lightly caramelized.
  * Add imitation crab, shrimp, and salad shrimp.
  * Cook just until raw shrimp becomes opaque.
  * Sprinkle mixture with half a teaspoon or so of Old Bay Seasoning.
  * Combine cooked rice and seafood mixture.
  * Add more Old Bay Seasoning, salt and pepper to taste.
  * Enjoy!

I love this dish but I never knew how to make it because the person wanted to
keep it to their self. Now I have it and make it on my own thank you for the
recipe. I will be cooking this for my super bowl party in miami 2010

I took this dish to my brother's for Thanksgiving and believe me, there were
no leftovers. Dinner is at my sister's for Christmas and the only thing I am
required to bring is this dish. Kudos! MsV
