#  Ol' Fuskie Fried Crab Rice

Getting reviews...

Long as I can remember, crab rice was a monthly treat around our house. As
I've raised my own family -- sometimes near the water, sometimes not so near
-- I've cherished this dish and added a few touches of my own. If there's a
picnic or a family gathering, I'll find a way to get some crabs. When I find
folks with a dock, it's not long before I'll be asking them if I can set out a
crab trap or two. Because as soon as someone tastes ol' Fuskie crab rice,
they're likely to be asking me to make it. My kids beg for crab rice all the
time, and just like my mother did with us girls, I make them help me pick the
crabs. We sit out on the porch or around the kitchen table, spread some
newspapers and go to pickin'. The more hands we've got, the sooner we're ready
to cook.

##  Ingredients

1 1/2 cups uncooked rice

2 1/4 cups warm water

Pinch salt

2 strips bacon

1/4 cup vegetable oil

##  Directions

  1. Measure the dry rice; then rinse and drain it several times. Put it the rice, water, and salt in a medium pot. Cover, bring to a boil, and simmer until the rice is done and the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes or more. 
  2. Fry the bacon until crispy in a 12-inch skillet; when the bacon is done, remove it from the pan, set aside, and crumble when cool. Add the oil to the bacon fat in the skillet and heat. Add the celery, bell pepper, and onion. Stir-fry until the onions are clear; then add the crab and cook until the crab begins to brown, another 5 to 10 minutes. Add the crumbled bacon, cooked rice, and garlic powder, along with salt and pepper to taste, and stir constantly until evenly combined. Cover the mixture and simmer for at least 10 minutes. (If you'd like a meatier mixture, just use more crab and less rice.)
