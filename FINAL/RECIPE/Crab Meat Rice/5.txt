# Gullah Inspired Crab Rice

Recipes

Jul 9

Written By Guest User

### GULLAH INSPIRED “DIRTY RICE”

After watching season 1, episode 4 of Taste The Nation on Hulu, which was
about the Gullah people of South Carolina, I was inspired to make this crab
rice. Since I wanted to keep the recipe as authentic as possible, I found this
recipe by Sallie Ann Robinson which I loosely followed but I added a few more
spices and changed things up somewhat.

### Crab Rice

Cook time: 40 MinTotal time: 40 Min

### Ingredients

  * 2 cups dry rice (preferably Carolina gold)
  * 3 1/2 cups of water
  * 1 tbsp butter
  * 3 strips of bacon
  * 1/3 cup vegetable oil
  * 1 medium green bell pepper chopped
  * 1 small onion chopped
  * 1 stalk of celery chopped
  * 8oz (1/2 pound) of crab meat (lump or claw is fine, fresh is best)
  * 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder
  * 1 teaspoon maggi chicken bullion, or 1 cubed chicken bullion and 1/2 cup water
  * salt & pepper
  * 1/2 tbsp cajun seasoning
  * 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika

### Instructions

  1. Add the rice in a pot with water, butter and a pinch of salt & pepper. Bring to a boil, stir, cover. Turn heat to low and let simmer for 20 minutes or until all the water evaporates and the rice is done.

Add oil to skillet with bacon grease on high heat. Once hot add in the celery, peppers and onions, season with a pinch of salt & pepper and cook until soft on medium heat, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.
  3. Add crab meat to the skillet and season with old bay, cajun, smoke paprika and garlic powder. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  4. Add 1 teaspoon of chicken bullion and 1/2 cup water to the skillet. Bring to a boil and let liquid reduce by half. Add in the cooked rice, stir to incorporate everything together and cook for about 5 additional minutes and your all done.
  5. Plate and Enjoy!
