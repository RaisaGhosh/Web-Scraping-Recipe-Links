These pan fried momos are so yummy that you can have them as main dish. Folded
with veggies and dipped in soy sauce makes the dish more delicious. Something
new to try other than steamed momos.

My whole family is foodie , we keep venturing out and try new variations all
the time.. One of the variations that we tried in recent times is momos…
Usually we steam them with different types of veggies but this time we tried
to pan fry it and this was a super hit! Very easy to make within so much less
time!

Where momos originated is hard to tell. Some research says its Tibet and some
say it’s Nepal others say its China.. But it’s actually native to Northeast
India, Tibet, Nepal, East and South Asia including China and momos are mostly
steamed. Well, as new generation adapt to new taste steamed momos got it
different versions.

Not may restaurants have pan fried momos, infact I have never tasted pan fried
momos in any restaurants here in USA. May be because it’s not so common? Well,
who knows and I have never been to momos native region. But I did eat pan
fried momos many many years ago in Bylakuppe Tibetan settlement in Karnataka,
India. Not that i still remember the taste but when I ended up making these at
home I could definitely relate the taste. You guys should definitely try this
out. It's super yummy.

Let’s gather the ingredients.

All purpose flour, lots of different veggies, soy sauce , garlic, ginger and a
sieve or cheese cloth to drain excess water from veggies.

     Ingredients for dough 

     Ingredients for filling 

     Veggies resting with salt 

     Squeeze the water from veggies 

     Add soy sauce and cook the veggies till the water content gets evaporated 

     Fold the momos and pan fry them 

_Tip: One of the main steps i would like to highlight here is squeeze out
excess water from veggies and cook them till they get dry. This will make the
momos crispy._

#### Equipment

  * Pan
  * Cheese Cloth

#### Ingredients

###### For Dough

  * 1 Cup All purpose flour __ Maida
  * 1/4 Tsp Salt
  * 1 Tbsp Oil
  * 1/4 Cup Water

###### For Momos

  * 1 Cup Cabbage __ Shredded
  * 1/2 Cup Carrot __ Shredded
  * 1/4 Cup Green onions __ Chopped
  * 1/4 Cup Green Beans __ Finely Chopped
  * 1/4 Cup Bell Peppers __ Finely Chopped
  * 1 Tsp Ginger __ Grated
  * 2 Cloves Garlic __ Minced
  * 1 Tsp Salt
  * 1 Tsp Black Pepper
  * 1 Tbsp Soy Sauce
  * 1 Tbsp Oil

#### Instructions

###### Make the dough

  1.  **Make the momos dough:** In a mixing bowl whisk together the flour and salt. Add the water and oil and mix the dough until it comes together.
  2.  **Knead the dough:** Transfer onto a floured counter and knead the dough, adding more flour as necessary, until you have a smooth dough.
  3.  **Rest:** Cover with a damp towel and let the dough rest for 30 minutes while you prepare the filling

###### For the filling

  1. **Filling:** Add the shredded cabbage, shredded carrot, beans bell pepper and sliced scallions in a large mixing bowl. Add the salt and toss to combine. Let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes.
  2.  **Sqeeze:** Transfer the veggies into a cheese cloth and squeeze out extra water.
  3.  **Note:** I usually collect the squeezed water and use it as veggie stock in my soup.
  4.  **Cook veggies:** Take a pan and add about 1 tsp of oil. Add ginger and garlic with drained veggies with salt, pepper and soya sauce. Cook until the veggies get dry. This is important if you want crispy momo’s. Keep it aside.

###### Make the Momos

  1.  **Roll the dough:** Take a pan and add about 1 tsp of oil. Add ginger and garlic with drained veggies with salt, pepper and soya sauce. Cook until the veggies get dry. This is important if you want crispy momo’s. Keep it aside.
  2.  **Cut into circles:** Using a cookie cutter cut it into circles. Remove the scraps of dough and place it under the damp towel.
  3.  **Alternatively:** If you dint have cookie cutter: Divide the dough into 12-15 small balls and leave them under damp towel so that it doesn’t dry up. Take 1 ball at a time a roll it into circles and as thin as possible.
  4.  **Assemble:** Taking one piece of circle at a time put about 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of the dough, then fold and pinch the dough together to form frills then hold all the frills together and twist it to seal the opening.
  5.  **Pan fry:** Place the momo’s in a wide pan with 1 tbsp oil in low-medium heat.Make sure its low- medium heat. Since we are not steaming the momo’s its important to cook in low flame. Covered with lid for 1-2 minuets for flour to get cooked.
  6.  **Fry more:** Leave the moms for 1 more minute and then flip it to roast them on other side for about 2-3 minutes. You don’t have to cover it this time just roast it in low- medium flame. You should be able to see that momo’s are turning crunchy. You can leave it on pan a little longer if you think you should.
  7.  **Serve:** Serve the dumplings warm with Soy sauce.

#### Notes

  * Squeeze out excess water from veggies and cook them till they get dry. This will make the momo’s crispy.
  * Squeezed water can be used as veggie stock in any soup.
  * You can choose to add tofu as well as cottage cheese as well.
  * Leftover dumplings can be reheated by pan frying them for a minute each side.

### Happy cooking
