## Burmese Khow Suey (noodles in a curried coconut sauce)

If something can be called a bowl of happiness, this could well be it. Khow
Suey is a delicious noodle dish from Burma made with egg noodles, curried
chicken and coconut milk. Served with a variety of condiments, each spoon full
of soup you eat will be bursting with flavours! Khow Suey is probably the
first thing that comes to mind when you think about Burmese cuisine.

Prep Time30 mins

Cook Time30 mins

Total Time1 hr

Course: Main Course, Main Dish, noodles pasta

Cuisine: Burmese

Keyword: burmese soup, egg noodles, khow suey, noodle soup

Servings: 4 serving

### Ingredients

  * 500 grams chicken cut to bite-size pieces
  * 300 grams egg noodles
  * 1/2 cup shallots thinly sliced
  * 1/4 cup garlic thinly sliced
  * 3 small red chilies Optional. You can use all green chillies. 
  * 2 green chilies slit lengthwise
  * 1 inch ginger grated
  * 500 ml coconut milk
  * 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
  * 1 tablespoon gram flour (chickpea flour/besan)
  * 2 sprigs cilantro (coriander leaves)
  * 2 sprigs curry leaves
  * 1 spring onions (preferably scallions/green onions)
  * 1 lime wedges
  * salt to taste
  * 4 boiled eggs peeled and sliced into halves

### Instructions

  * Heat some oil in a pan. When the oil is hot enough, reduce the flame and fry HALF of the thinly sliced garlic.

  * As soon as they start turning brown, scoop them out on to a paper towel to soak up the oil.

  * Now fry HALF of the thinly sliced shallots. Keep them along with the fried garlic. Leave the oil in the pan.

  * Add chicken pieces to the pan and start frying them. Add more oil if you have to. 

  * Once the chicken starts turning brown, add the curry leaves, grated ginger, and the remaining chopped garlic and sliced shallots. 

  * Fry this for 5 minutes while stirring occasionally. 

  * Add the chickpea flour, turmeric powder, and salt. 

  * Thinly slice the chillies. I added two green chillies and one red chilli to this mix. Cook for another 5 minutes.

  * Cook the egg noodles following the instructions on the package. 

  * Drain the noodles, and wash them in cold water. Leave it on a colander to drain the water. (Tip: Don't leave the noodles out for long. They'll go dry and stick to each other)

  * Your curried chicken should be cooked by now with a nice aroma filling up the kitchen. 

  * Add the coconut milk, stir well, and bring to a simmer. 

  * Cook in medium heat. If the temperature goes high, the coconut milk will curdle. 

  * Add salt if required. Switch off. 

  * Serve hot - place some noodles and a sliced egg in a bowl, with some finely chopped cilantro, and pour the curried chicken over it. 

  * Garnish with spring onions (ideally scallions, but I couldn't source this). 

Provide all other accompaniments in small bowls - fried garlic, fried
shallots, cilantro, chillies and lime wedges. MUST DO: For the perfect taste,
squeeze some lime into your noodle soup just before eating.

### Notes

  * It'll be easy if you are using breast pieces of chicken. In my experience, using smaller pieces after removing bones (definitely time consuming) adds more flavour.
  * Coconut milk doesn't have to be thick. To reach the required quantity, it's okay to add some water.

Hi! Would it be possible to use some other flour instead of besan? Rice flour
perhaps?

    * The Take It Easy Chef

August, 2020 at 10:12 pm  *  Reply

Rice flour might not work the same way as besan. Maybe a hint of maida?

Hi !

I’ve been wanting to try out Khao Suey and came across your recipe. Since my
wife is Vegetarian, can you suggest which vegetables would go best in lieu of
the chicken .

Thanks !

Hi Dhruv,  
Apologies for the delayed response.  
I hope you do get to see this comment next time when you visit the blog.  
You can keep the recipe and ingredients more or less the same.  
Tofu would be a decent substitute for chicken.

Place one or two parottas on a plate. Pour a generous helping of chicken salna
on the side. Let the curry slowly trickle into the crispy, flaky parotta. When
they meet, there is magic! Tear a piece of parotta soaked in the salna and put
it in your mouth. Gently chew and feel all the textures - The crispiness of
the outer layers. The slightly soggy bit with the salna. This is street food
at its best. This is an improved version of the chicken salna I had posted
before. I thought this would be a good one to resume here. . This chicken
salna recipe, like many other popular recipes on this blog, is from a mom's
kitchen. I got this recipe from my cousin. He sourced it from a friend who got
it from his mom. This chicken salna recipe will help you cook your favourite
street food in the comfort of your kitchen. . Check out the recipe from the

This whole wheat jaggery cake is a healthier take on the classic pound cake.
This delightful cake is moist, light, and airy and a perfect companion for
your hot cup of tea! . We are not using regular flour or sugar. Instead, we
have healthier calories from whole wheat flour and jaggery. Instead of butter,
the main ingredient is oil. The only butter in this recipe is for greasing the
cake pan. By the way, did I tell you that this is an eggless cake as well? .

Think of potato podimas as a flavourful Indian version of mashed potatoes
cooked with a seasoning of mustard seeds, urad dal, and curry leaves. .
Imagine the fragrance when mustard seeds, urad dal, and fresh curry leaves are
tempered in oil. Now add mashed potatoes to the pan. The smooth, creamy mashed
potatoes will absorb all the great flavours. That, my friends, is the story of
any good potato podimas! . There is nothing pretentious about potato podimas!
It is a simple preparation with some basic ingredients. For an Indian recipe,
it requires very few spices. Potato podimas is probably a South Indian
rendition of the classic mashed potatoes. But it is quintessentially Indian
and a delicious dish that you can put together without any effort. . Check out
the easy recipe with step-by-step pictures from the link in the bio. . . . . .

Easy Butter Chicken . Now you can create a restaurant-style butter chicken

select whole spices and butter. This butter chicken recipe is a crowd-pleaser.

guilty savouring this delicious chicken curry. I have kept cream as an
