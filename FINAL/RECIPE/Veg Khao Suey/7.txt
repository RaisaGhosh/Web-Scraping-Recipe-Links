# Burmese Khow Suey Recipe

Posted On February 21, 2021

Khow Suey is a Burmese noodles recipe served with coconut milk-based curry
along with lots of exotic vegetables. The heart of this dish is Khow Suey
paste made with ginger, garlic, lemongrass, turmeric, lemon zest or leaves,
coriander powder, and red chili powder.

In this recipe, I have given a twist by adding all fresh ingredients such as
raw turmeric, coriander seeds and redbird eye chili. The paste is strong in
flavors with all pungent ingredients which then blends with sweet coconut
milk, making it a subtle, sweet and tangy delectable dish. The sprinkle of
condiments above it is bang on. It adds crunchiness and accentuates its
appearance and taste.

**Prep time:** 30 min

**Cook time:** 15 min

**Serves:** 3

## Curry Paste **Ingredients**

1 medium size Onion

Index finger size raw Turmeric ****

Index finger size Ginger

14-16 Cloves Garlic

2 Lemon leaves

1 tbsp coriander seeds

3-4 bird eye chili

## Khow Suey paste recipe

Put all the above ingredients into the mixing bowl and grind it to make a
smooth paste.

If raw turmeric and bird eye chilis are not available, you can use 2 tsp
turmeric powder and 2 tsp red chili powder respectively as an alternative.

## Curry Ingredients

1 small stick Lemongrass

1/4 cup red bell pepper

1/4 cup yellow bell pepper

1/4 cup green bell pepper

1/3 cup broccoli

1/3 cup baby corn

1/3 cup zucchini

Curry paste

2 cup coconut milk

2 tbsp gram flour

2 tbsp oil

1 tsp sugar

Salt as per requirement.

## Khow Suey Curry Recipe

Heat the oil in a pan and pour the above-made paste into it. Sauté it for 2
minutes to remove the rawness of the ingredients.

Once the oil separates, add gram flour, and cook it for 2 minutes with
continuous stirring.

Next pour coconut milk. Whisk it continuously to avoid forming lumps. Bring
the milk to a boil and add all chopped vegetables into it.

Sprinkle salt as per requirement and let the curry simmer along with veggies
for around 7-10 minutes. It will thicken with time. Hence, if required, add
water to adjust the consistency of the curry.

Once done, add 1 tsp sugar. Stir the mixture and turn off the flame.

Serve the hot curry with garlic sautéd noodles and below mentioned condiments.

## **Condiments:**

Roasted peanuts

Chopped Bird eye chili

Chopped Coriander

Lemon

Fried Garlic

Fried onion

Fried noodles

Take noodles on the plate and pour curry above it. Then sprinkle all
condiments and squeeze a lemon into it.

A mouth-watering Khow Suey is ready to relish.
