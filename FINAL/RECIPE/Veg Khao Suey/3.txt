# About Veg Khow Suey Recipe:

In Burmese, âkhow sueyâ translates to rice noodles. It is believed that
the dish was born in Burma and reached East India with those who fled to the
country during World War II. Khow suey makes great comfort food. A version of
khow suey made with dry noodles can be found in some places like Yangon in
Myanmar. The khow suey eaten in India is similar to the Southern Myanmarese
âohn no khow sueyâ. âKhow soi Islamâ is a version of khow suey that
does not use pork and is prepared mainly by Muslims using chicken or beef. The
Malaysian dish laksa was derived from khow suey. Khow suey is essentially a
spicy coconut-milk based soup with noodles and meat, but this version uses
vegetables. It is usually served with toppings like fried shallots, fried
garlic, eggs, coriander and crushed peanuts.
