## Siew Mai

{{totalReview}}

Siew Mai, a tasty morsel in the dim sum world, is actually a dish that
originated from Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. It is an open-faced steam dumpling
traditionally made with minced pork wrapped in wonton pastry, steamed and
served in cute little bamboo baskets. One is never enough so be sure to make
some extras, which can be popped into the freezer for later.

### Instructions

  1. ### Marinate the prawns

    * In a mixing bowl, marinate the prawn meat with salt for 5 min, then wash away the salt under running water until the water runs clear.
    * Place the prawn in a colander to drain away as much water as possible.
