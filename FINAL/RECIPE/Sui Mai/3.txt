_Siu mai_ (SHOO-my), or _shaomai_ , are popular little steamed dumplings from
southeastern China. They are sold by shops as a quick snack food or from carts
in dim sum restaurants as part of a larger menu selection.

Makes 20 to 30 pieces

### Ingredients

  * Ground pork ground -- 1 pound
  * Shrimp, peeled, deveined and minced -- 1/2 pound
  * Dried shiitake mushrooms, soaked in hot water, destemmed and  minced -- 3 to 6
  * Bamboo shoots or water chestnuts, minced -- 1/4 cup
  * Scallions, minced -- 2 or 3
  * Egg, beaten -- 1
  * Cornstarch -- 2 tablespoons
  * Sesame oil -- 1 tablespoon
  * Sugar -- 2 teaspoons
  * Salt and pepper -- to season
  * Wonton wrappers -- 20 to 30

### Method

  1. Add all the ingredients except the wonton skins to a large bowl and mix together well with clean hands. You may alternatively use a food processor briefly to bring all ingredients together.
  2. Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle of each wonton skin. Bring the sides of the wrapper up around the filling to encase it like a small basket, leaving the top open and the filling exposed. Pleat the wrapper neatly to form a rounded shape. Press each siu mai down on a countertop to flatten their bottoms. Repeat with the rest of the filling and wonton skins.
  3. Set up a Chinese bamboo steamer and lightly oil the bottom of the steamer basket. Place the siu mai into the steamer (in batches if necessary), cover and steam for about 6 to 8 minutes per batch. Remove from heat and and serve immediately.

### Siu Mai Variations

  * **Optional seasonings** : Add 1 tablespoon of minced garlic or ginger, or both, to the filling. Other possible additions: 2 tablespoons soy sauce; 1 or 2 tablespoons oyster sauce; 1 or 2 tablespoons rice wine or dry sherry.
  * Pork and Cabbage Filling also works well for siu mai.
  * For decoration, siu mai are sometimes topped with a dab of orange fish roe, a small diced piece of steamed carrot or a pea.
