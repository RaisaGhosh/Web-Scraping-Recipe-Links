# Paneer Chow Mein

Chow Mein is a Chinese stir fried noodles dish. Chinese cuisine is very
popular in India and there are many variants of vegetarian Chinese delicacies.

###  Some Tips/ Suggestions:

  1. You can use instant noodles, flat noodles, wheat noodles or any other noodles as per availability and taste.
  2. You can also use some other veggies like bean sprouts, bok choy, baby corn etc. in this preparation.
  3. For stir frying iron wok would be ideal. Do not use non stick woks for stir frying as frying is to be done on high heat and this can damage the non stick coating.
