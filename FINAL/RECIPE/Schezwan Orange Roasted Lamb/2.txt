# Lamb With Sichuan Pepper And Orange Food

        

### LAMB WITH SICHUAN PEPPER AND ORANGE

######

Provided by Robert Farrar Capon

Categories      dinner, main course

Time 20m

Yield 2 or more servings

Number Of Ingredients 7

  * Ingredients

1/4 cup peanut oil  
---  
Rind of a large, fragrant orange, cut into eighths (white pulp removed)  
2 hot red chili peppers  
2 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns (ordinary black peppercorns, crushed, may be
substituted)  
3/4 pound lean raw lamb  
Salt to taste  
2 large onions, sliced into thin rings  
  
Steps:

  * Heat the oil in a wok and fry the orange peel in it until lightly browned. Remove both oil and peel and set aside. When the peel is cool enough to handle, cut it into fine julienne strips. Reserve the oil.
  * Seed the chili peppers and cut them into julienne strips. Add to the orange shreds and set aside.
  * Put the peppercorns in a dry skillet, toast them over moderate heat until they begin to smoke, then remove and crush fine in a mortar.
  * Cut the lamb across the grain into fairly uniform slices ( 3/8 inches thick and 1 to 1 1/2 inches long). Put them in a bowl and mix thoroughly with the crushed pepper.
  * Heat the wok in which the peel was fried until very hot, spread out the lamb slices in a single layer and fry them for 1 minute without moving them. Then stir-fry vigorously for 10 to 20 seconds and remove quickly to a serving dish. (They will still be raw in the center at this point.)
  * In the wok, heat the reserved orange oil until hot again, add salt to taste and stir-fry the onion rings until nicely browned. Add the orange peel, the red-pepper shreds and the lamb, stir-fry for 5 to 10 seconds and dish up. Serve over noodles dressed with a little sesame oil and soy sauce.

  * 1\. In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce, bean paste, shao hsing, cumin, chilli, five-spice and sugar. Take a heavy, deep roasting tray large enough to fit the lamb shoulder. Rub the marinade all over the meat, cover the tray with cling film and leave to marinate for a few hours or, better still, overnight in the fridge.
  * 2\. Preheat the oven to 150C. Remove the cling film from the lamb and add 250ml water to the roasting tray. Cover the tray tightly with aluminium foil, then place in oven and roast for two hours. Turn the oven down to 110C and cook for a further four hours, checking every so often and adding a little more water if the tray becomes dry.
  * 3\. For the last hour remove the foil and drizzle the two tablespoons of grapeseed oil over the lamb and continue to cook for the last hour of roasting to crisp up the skin.
  * 4\. While the lamb is roasting, make the Sichuan sauce and the coriander and mint paste. Transfer the lamb to a deep dish, and pour the Sichuan sauce over the top. Finish the dish with the chilli oil and ground Sichuan pepper. Serve with flatbread and coriander and mint paste.
