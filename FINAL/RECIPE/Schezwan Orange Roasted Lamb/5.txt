Although Chinese ordinarily do not like lamb, they have not tasted lamb in the
West, where it is delicate and more subtle than the stronger-tasting one from
China.

Here I have combined the lamb with orange for a lovely contrast to the rich
meat. The tartness of the fresh orange peel works well to balance the robust
taste of the lamb. It is an easy dish to make and the spicy flavours add to
its appeal. Serve it with plain rice and vegetables for a wholesome meal.
