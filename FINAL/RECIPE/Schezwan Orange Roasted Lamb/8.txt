Geographic extent of Sichuan cuisine

**Sichuan cuisine** , alternatively romanized as **Szechwan cuisine** or
**Szechuan cuisine** (Chinese: 四川, Standard Mandarin pronunciation:
[sî.ʈʂʰwán] (listen)), is a style of Chinese cuisine originating from
Sichuan Province. It has bold flavours, particularly the pungency and
spiciness resulting from liberal use of garlic and chili peppers, as well as
the unique flavour of Sichuan pepper. Some examples are Kung Pao Chicken and
Yuxiang shredded pork. There are many local variations within Sichuan Province
and the neighbouring Chongqing Municipality, which was part of Sichuan
Province until 1997. Four sub-styles of Sichuan cuisine include Chongqing,
Chengdu, Zigong and Buddhist vegetarian style.[1]

UNESCO declared Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, to be a city of
gastronomy in 2011 to recognise the sophistication of its cooking.[2]

## History[edit]

Sichuan in the Middle Ages welcomed Middle Eastern crops, such as broad beans,
sesame and walnuts. Since the 16th century, the list of major crops in Sichuan
has even been lengthened by New World newcomers. The characteristic chili
pepper came from Mexico, but probably overland from India or by river from
Macau, complementing the traditional Sichuan peppercorn (花椒; _huājiāo_ ).
Other newcomers from the New World included maize (corn), which largely
replaced millet; white potatoes introduced by Catholic missions; and sweet
potatoes. The population of Sichuan was cut by perhaps three quarters in the
wars from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty. Settlers from the adjacent
Hunan Province brought their cooking styles with them.[3]

Sichuan is colloquially known as the "heavenly country" due to its abundance
of food and natural resources. One ancient Chinese account declared that the
"people of Sichuan uphold good flavour, and they are fond of hot and spicy
taste." Most Sichuan dishes are spicy, although a typical meal includes non-
spicy dishes to cool the palate. Sichuan cuisine is composed of seven basic
flavours: sour, pungent, hot, sweet, bitter, aromatic and salty. Sichuan food
is divided into five different types: sumptuous banquet, ordinary banquet,
popularised food, household-style food and snacks. Milder versions of Sichuan
dishes remain a staple of American Chinese cuisine.[4]

The superior natural resources of Sichuan Province provided plenty natural
resources for the development of cooking. The flow of Yangtze river (the third
longest river in the world and the longest river in China) through Sichuan
Province sat the fundamental food materials, spices, and water resources.[5]

## Features[edit]

The complex topography of Sichuan Province, including its mountains, hills,
plains, plateaus and the Sichuan Basin, has shaped its food customs with
versatile and distinct ingredients.

Abundant rice and vegetables are produced from the fertile Sichuan Basin,
whereas a wide variety of herbs, mushrooms and other fungi prosper in the
highland regions. Pork is overwhelmingly the most common type of meat
consumed.[3] Beef is somewhat more common in Sichuan cuisine than it is in
other Chinese cuisines, perhaps due to the prevalence of oxen in the
region.[6] Sichuan cuisine also uses various bovine and porcine organs as
ingredients, such as intestine, arteries, head, tongue, skin and liver, in
addition to other commonly used portions of the meat. Rabbit meat is also much
more popular in Sichuan than elsewhere in China. It is estimated that the
Sichuan Basin and Chongqing area are responsible for about 70 percent of
China's total rabbit meat consumption.[7] Yoghurt, which probably spread from
India through Tibet in medieval times, is consumed among the Han Chinese. This
is an unusual custom in other parts of the country. The salt produced from
Sichuan salt springs and wells, unlike sea salt, does not contain iodine,
which led to goiter problems before the 20th century.[3]

Sichuan cuisine often contains food preserved through pickling, salting and
drying. Preserved dishes are generally served as spicy dishes with heavy
application of chili oil.

The most unique and important spice in Sichuan cuisine is the Sichuan pepper
(花椒; _huājiāo_ ; 'flower pepper'). Sichuan peppercorn has an intense fragrant,
citrus-like flavour and produces a "tingly-numbing" (麻; _má_ ) sensation in
the mouth. Other commonly used spices in Sichuan cuisine are garlic, chili
peppers, ginger and star anise.

Sichuan hotpot, the most famous Chinese hotpot, is one of the representative
dishes in Sichuan cuisine and famous for its numb and spicy taste.[8]

Broad bean chili paste (豆瓣酱; 豆瓣醬; _dòubànjiàng_ ) is one of the most important
seasonings.[3] It is an essential component to famous dishes such as Mapo tofu
and double-cooked pork slices. Sichuan cuisine is the origin of several
prominent sauces/flavours widely used in modern Chinese cuisine, including:

  * _Yuxiang_ (魚香)
  * _Mala_ (麻辣)
  * _Guaiwei_ (怪味)

Other examples of mixed flavor including spicy and hot ( _Mala),_ fish flavor
( _Yuxiang_ ), hot and sour, the five spices ( _Wuxiang;_ 五香), ginger juice,
mashed garlic, sweet and sour, spice salt ( _Jiaoyan_ ; 椒盐), dried tangerine
or orange peel ( _Chenpi_ ; 陈皮), burnt chili, pot-stewed fowl ( _Lu_ ; 卤味),
odd flavor ( _Guaiwei_ ; 怪味), and other recombinations of these seasonings.[9]

Common preparation techniques in Sichuan cuisine include stir frying, steaming
and braising, but a complete list would include more than 20 distinct
techniques.
