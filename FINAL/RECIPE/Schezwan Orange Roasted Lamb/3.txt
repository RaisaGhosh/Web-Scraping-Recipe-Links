## Ingredients

###

2 tablespoons soy sauce

125 ml (4 fl oz/½ cup) orange juice

1/4 teaspoon bicarbarbonate of soda (baking soda)

2 teaspoons cornflour (cornstarch)

2 teaspoons crushed sichuan peppercorns

3 tablespoons peanut oil

350 g (12 oz) lamb fillet, thinly sliced

5 cm (2 in) piece fresh ginger, julienned

4 star anise

2 garlic cloves, crushed

10 thin spring onions (scallions), cut into 2.5 cm (1 in) lengths

200 g (7 oz) snowpeas (mangetout), trimmed and cut on the diagonal

2 small red chillies, finely sliced

2 tablespoons oyster sauce

2 tablespoons Chinese rice wine

1/2 teaspoon sugar

Coconut rice

200 ml (7 fl oz) coconut cream

200 g (7 oz/1 cup) basmati rice

## Method

**1.** Put the soy sauce, orange juice, bicarbonate of soda, cornflour,
peppercorns and 1 tablespoon of oil in a bowl, add the lamb and marinate in
the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Drain, reserving the marinade.

**2.** While the lamb is marinating, prepare the coconut rice. Mix the coconut
cream with 200 ml (7 fl oz) of water and 1 teaspoon of salt in a large
saucepan. Stir the rice, bring to the boil over high heat, then reduce the
heat and simmer for 10 minutes.

**3.** Heat a wok over high heat, add about 1 tablespoon of oil and stir-fry
the lamb in batches for 1–2 minutes, or until just seared.

**4.** Heat the remaining oil, add the ginger, star anise, garlic, spring
onion, snowpeas and chilli and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Return the lamb to the
wok with the marinade and the combined oyster sauce, rice wine and sugar.
Stir-fry for 1 minute, then serve with the coconut rice.
