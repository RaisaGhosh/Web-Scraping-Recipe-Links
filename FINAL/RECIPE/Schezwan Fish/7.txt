# Sichuan boiled fish (Shui Zhu Yu, Ê∞¥ÁÖÆÈ±º)

**Tendre fish fillet poached in seasoned water, then topped with spices,
Sichuan boiled fish is tasty, pungent and super addictive.  **

I still remember exactly where I ate Sichuan boiled fish (Shui Zhu Yu, Ê∞¥ÁÖÆÈ±º)
for the first time. It was a tiny little restaurant specializing in Sichuan
cuisine hidden in a quiet neighbourhood of Beijing. At that moment, I only
knew a few famous Sichuan dishes, such as Mapo tofu, Kong Pao chicken,
Shredded pork with garlic sauce, etc.. I found Sichuan boiled fish so stunning
that later on it became the one dish that I always order whenever it‚Äôs on the
menu.

## It‚Äôs tender & succulent

Literally, the Chinese name of Sichuan boil fish ‚ÄúShui Zhu Yu (Ê∞¥ÁÖÆÈ±º)‚Äù means
water boiled fish. The marinated fish slices are poached briefly in seasoned
water. They taste very tender, succulent and packed with flavour.

To achieve the best result, I recommend you use fresh fillets instead of
frozen ones. In China, restaurants often have fish tanks from which the
customers can choose live fish to be freshly prepared for this dish (Don't
fancy fish, try Sichuan Boiled Beef instead).

## It‚Äôs super spicy

As one of the most pungent Chinese dishes, authentic Sichuan boiled fish is
famous for its hotness. My friend Junyang adored this dish but unfortunately,
she has a low tolerance for spicy food. She used to rinse the fish in a glass
of water to reduce the hotness. And little by little she has eventually
increased her tolerance.

In my recipe, you can see that the spiciness comes from the generous use of 3
ingredients: dried chilli, Sichuan chilli bean paste and chilli powder.

## It gives you a numbing sensation

Sichuan boiled fish is also pungent in another way: it delivers an intensive
numbing sensation to your mouth by using quite a lot of Sichuan pepper (it‚Äôs
an acquired taste but very addictive once you become accustomed to it).

You might have heard or used regular Sichuan pepper (Huajiao, Ëä±Ê§í) which is red
in colour. In fact, there is another type of Sichuan pepper called Majiao (È∫ªÊ§í)
which has the same shape and size but is green in colour. It‚Äôs often used in
Sichuan boiled fish to enhance the fragrance. However, you can use regular
Sichuan pepper if you can‚Äôt find the green ones.

## It‚Äôs easy to cook!

Many people find it intimidating to cook Sichuan boiled fish at home. I was
one of them until I had a try. It‚Äôs pretty straight forward. There‚Äôs no
particular cooking skill involved. As long as you have all the ingredients to
hand and follow a detailed, well-written recipe, nothing will go wrong.

When reading the recipe card below, you will notice that I put ingredients in
several groups. This corresponds to different cooking steps. Please note that
cooking oil is listed in different groups for various purpose. The finished
dish doesn‚Äôt taste greasy despite the generous use of oil. The oil is
essential to draw out the full fragrance of the spices.

### Instructions

####  **Marinate the fish**

  * Slice the fish fillet diagonally. Marinate with salt, white pepper, rice wine & corn starch.

####  **Fry the spices**

  * In a wok (or a deep frying pan), fry dried chilli and Sichuan pepper in oil over a low heat until fragrant (do not burn them). Chop coarsely when cooled. Set aside.

####  **Cook the vegetable**

  * In the same wok, heat up oil over a medium heat, stir in celery. Cook for 1.5 minutes or so (30 seconds if using bean sprouts instead). Transfer to a serving bowl. Set aside.

####  **Make the broth**

  * Heat up oil in the wok, fry garlic, ginger and spring onion. Add Sichuan chilli bean paste and chilli powder. Pour in water (or chicken stock). Bring it to a full boil.

#### Cook the fish

  * Gently place the fish slices into the wok. When cooked, pour the fish and the soup onto the vegetable.

####  **Garnishing**

  * Top with fried spices and coriander. Heat up oil then pour over to sizzle the spices. Serve immediately with plain rice.

### NOTES

1\. You may use catfish, cod, sea bass, pangasius, etc.

2\. I use two different types of Sichuan peppercorn in this dish: the red,
regular Sichuan pepper and green ones. Please feel free to use whatever is
available to you.

3\. Different brands of Sichuan chilli bean paste (aka spicy Doubanjiang/Ëæ£Ë±ÜÁì£ÈÖ±)
may vary in saltiness, hotness and texture. Adjust the volume accordingly.
Best to use Pixian Douban (ÈÉ´ÂéøË±ÜÁì£), a well-known variety, which needs to be
coarsely chopped prior to cooking.

Would salmon work with this recipe?

Salmon isn't a traditional choice. Since it becomes quite flakey after
cooking, it isn't ideal for this dish in my opinion.

Slices of slivered carrots and diced baby corn is how I usually make this  
savory dish. Black mushroom and black fungus is also put in with  
Chinese cabbage and American celery slices to round up the vegetable  
medley. I add Jalepeno peppers to add additional kick

What is the best fish to use for this recipe? I followed your recipe as close
as I could, but I could not get all of them. I bought flounder, and it turned
out not very good. The vegetables and sauce was good. Thx.
