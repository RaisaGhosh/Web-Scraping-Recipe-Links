This is my first time to make this dish and quite surprise that it's easy to
make considering how delicious it is- hot and spicy-delicious!! I've added
this to my favorites. √º This will be included in the simple Chinese New Year
dinner that I'm planning - we're not really Chinese, I just want to join in
the fun of welcoming the new Lunar year, there's no harm in that‚Ä¶

just good food and good karma and good luck-lots of it, I hope!. üòÄ

**_Fish in Szechuan Sauce:_**

after frying the fish, saute the ginger, garlic and chili and scallions in the
same pan,

add the chili-garlic sauce, hot sauce and the slurry [broth +cornstarch] and
simmer. I used beer and water to sub for the broth..rather than just plain
water- that explains why my sauce is too bubbly. ^-^

put the fried fish back in to braise - you may use fish fillet, too. But whole
fish for Chinese New Year's supposed to bring prosperity/abundance or good
luck..not really sure what but they're all good so bring it on! üôÇ

Serve immediately while the sauce is still hot.. nom.nom.nom.  
The kids couldn't handle this so I'm going to tame it a little for them next
time and make an extra sauce with more chilli flakes and hot sauce (to make it
scorching hot) just for me and my husband; that will make everyone happy! üòÄ

### Equipment (click equipment to buy it)

Frying Pan

Serving Platter

Paper Towel

Teaspoon

Small Bowl

### Ingredients (click ingredient to buy it)

  * 1 whole Tilapia Fish or fish fillet, cleaned and washed
  * 1 pc Lemon or Calamansi Juice
  * Salt to taste
  * Black Pepper to taste
  * Ginger grated
  * 4 cloves Garlic minced
  * Scallions or Green Onion / sliced thinly
  * 2 teaspoons Red Chili Pepper Flakes
  * 1/2 cup Chicken Stock or water
  * 1/2 teaspoon Cornstarch
  * 1 tablespoon Soy Sauce
  * 1 1/2 tablespoons Chili Garlic Sauce
  * 1 tablespoon Hot Sauce
  * 1 teaspoon Sugar

### Instructions

  * Heat a frying pan (big enough to fit the fish) and add vegetable oil.

  * Pour lemon or calamansi juice over the fish and rub to get rid of the fishy smell. Season with salt and ground black pepper.

  * Fry seasoned fish in the preheated cooking oil in a pan until brown and crispy on both sides. Transfer to a platter with a paper towel to drain excess oil. Set aside.

  * Using the same pan, discard oil from fying the fish; pour about about a teaspoon of olive oil and a teaspoon of sesame oil in the pan.

  * Saute ginger, garlic, onion, chilli flakes for about a minute; add soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, hot sauce and sugar in a pan and bring to simmer.

  * Combine broth and cornstarch in small bowl; stir to dissolve cornstarch, add into the pan to thicken the sauce.

  * Bring to simmer again and let cook for another minute; adjust consistency of the sauce by adding more water for thinner sauce or by letting it simmer for a few more minutes to thicken or add more slurry ( water-cornstarch mixture).
