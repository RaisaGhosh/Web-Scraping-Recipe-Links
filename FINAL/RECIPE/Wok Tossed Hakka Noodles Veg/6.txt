# Vegetable Hakka Noodles (vegan)

Jump to Recipe

_Vegetable Hakka Noodles are Indo-Chinese noodles prepared with onions, bell
peppers, cabbage, carrots, and scallions. Great for meal-prep.  
  
_

Indo-Chinese cuisine is the BEST Chinese food. Yeah, it's not your typical
Chinese food, but rather an Indian style of making Chinese food flavored with
soy sauce, vinegar, Indian chili sauce, and sometimes even ketchup.

Indo-Chinese food is a street food that you can easily find on the streets of
India. Roadside food in India is just delicious.

Finding an Indo-Chinese restaurant is no easy task. While they're super
popular in India, they're not that common here in the United States. I'm
originally from New Jersey which has a high Indian population so you'll still
manage to find a few good Indo-Chinese spots. Now that I live in Southern
California, I haven't been to a single Indo-Chinese restaurant here because
they're barely any.

Needless to say, I miss Indo-Chinese cuisine a lot, and that's why I make it
at home.

## What is Vegetable Hakka Noodle?

These Indian-style Hakka Noodles are made in a **wok** on high heat. This dish
is widely popular at Indo-Chinese restaurants.

For this type of cooking, the prep work needs to be done ahead of time and the
entire cooking process should take no longer than 7 minutes. The key is to
cook the Hakka Noodles quickly on high heat so the veggies remain crunchy.
Indo-Chinese Hakka Noodles are prepared with noodles, lots of veggies, and
minimal sauces. The end result is delicious and flavorful noodles.

## Vegetable Hakka Noodles are:

  * Scrumptious
  * Flavorful
  * Vegan
  * Quick & Easy
  * Good Source of Vitamin A
  * Nutritious
  * Gluten-free - options available
  * Great for Meal prep

## Ingredients for Vegetable Hakka Noodles

**Ramen Noodles** : I love using my favorite **3-ingredient clean ramen
noodles**. They're my favorite and CLEAN!

**Garlic** : You'll need lots of garlic for this dish which adds a ton of
flavor.

**Veggies** : Onion, Red, Green & Yellow Bell Peppers, Carrots, Cabbage,
Scallions.

**Sauces** : Dark Soy Sauce for color and saltiness, **Ching 's Red Chili
Sauce**, Vinegar.

**Spices** : A little salt and black pepper. Don't overdo the salt as the
sauces already contain a high amount of sodium.

**Avocado Oil** : You'll need to work with a high-heat and flavorless oil such
as avocado oil. Canola and sunflower oils are other options.

## How to make Vegetable Hakka Noodles recipe step by step?

### Prep

1\. Boil a **pot of water**.  
2\. Once hot, add instant ramen noodles. I love **Ocean 's Halo Organic Ramen
Noodles** which contains only 3 ingredients. Cook the noodles according to the
package instructions. Alternatively, you can use **Ching 's Hakka Noodles 300
grams**.  
3\. Noodles are done.  

4\. Drain and rinse the noodles with cold water.  
5\. Set aside on a plate. Add 2 teaspoons of oil and coat the noodles. This
ensures the noodles don't stick together. Set aside.  

6\. Now chop the garlic and scallions - make sure you separate the white and
green parts of the scallions. Slice the red onions, red, yellow, and green
bell peppers. Julienne the carrots. Shred the cabbage. Set aside.  

### Cook the Hakka Noodles

1\. Heat up a **wok** on medium-high heat. Once hot, add 2 tbsp avocado oil,
or any flavorless oil that is suitable for high-heat (canola, vegetable work
well too). Once hot, add the garlic and saute for 20 seconds.  
2\. Immediately after, add the white portion of the scallions. Saute for 30
seconds.  
3\. Add the red onions and cook for another 30 seconds.  
4\. Add all 3 bell peppers and carrots. Cook for 30 seconds again.  
5\. Lastly, add the shredded cabbage and cook for 30 seconds. Season with very
little salt - like 1/4 tsp.  

6\. Now add the noodles.  
7\. Add the saucesâ€¦ dark soy sauce, red chili sauce, and rice wine vinegar.
Toss well so the noodles are coated well.  
8\. Add black pepper. Toss.  
9\. Garnish with remaining green scallions.  

10\. Toss.  

## Serving Suggestions

Vegetarian Noodles are great on their own, but you can make some **Baked Gobi
Manchurian** and **Indo-Chinese Fried Rice** to go with it.

For a spicy finish, top with some chili oil on top, I love **Trader Joe 's
Chili Onion Crunch**.

## Tips on making Perfect Hakka Noodles

  * **Prep all your veggies** in advance - chop your garlic and scallions, and thinly slice your remaining veggies. Again, make sure to **thinly slice the veggies.**
  * **Boil your noodles ahead of time **and rinse under cold water which prevents the noodles from sticking. 
  * Use a **wok** when making these noodles - avoid using nonstick, a stainless or iron walk will give you the best results and flavor.
  * **Follow this recipe to a T** and you won't mess it up.
  * Work quick, **don 't overcook the veggies** for long because you want to retain some crunch.

## Frequently Answered Questions

### 1\. What other Noodles can I use in these Hakka Noodles?

I've already tried making these noodles with whole-wheat spaghetti and it
**DOES NOT** work. The taste and texture will be off. I highly recommend using
**Ocean 's Halo Organic Ramen Noodles** found at Whole Foods, Walmart or
**Amazon**. These particular noodles contain just 3 ingredients and they taste
amazing.

Personally, I'm not a fan of **Ching 's Hakka Noodles** that you can find at
your local Desi grocery store due to the terrible ingredients. I feel
lethargic after so I'm not a fan of these cheap noodles. With that said, these
noodles will work well if you choose to use them.

### 2\. What other Veggies can I add to Hakka Noodles?

Veg Hakka Noodles are generally prepared with bell peppers, onion, scallions,
cabbage, and carrots. In addition to these veggies, you can also throw in some
baby corn for added crunch, asparagus, french beans, snow peas, celery, or
shitake mushrooms.

### 3\. Can I make Vegan Hakka Noodles?

Good news - these Hakka Noodles are already vegan.

### 4\. Can I make Gluten-free Hakka Noodles?

For gluten-free Hakka Noodles, use these **Millet & Brown Rice Ramen Noodles**
- they're clean and so delicious.

Additionally, make sure you use **gluten-free soy sauce**.

### 5\. How can I meal-prep Hakka Noodles?

Simply, chop up all the ingredients a couple of days prior. The day you're
ready to cook your noodles, boil your noodles, cook your veggies, and toss.
Simple!

### 6\. Can I make Healthy Hakka Noodles?

Sure. Make these noodles even healthier by using Millet & Brown Rice gluten-
free noodles. You can also throw in some protein - tofu, shrimp, and chicken
would all work well. Just make sure to grill up your choice of protein
separate and then add it in towards the end.

Loved reading your blog and making these recipes! I made these hakka noodles
today. I added more sauce (mostly for my taste) but my husband- who does not
like noodles at all- loved them too!! I also love the fact that you linked a
healthy noodle. I tried to search for a similar version at Wegmans and used
that! Thanks for all the amazing recipes!  
I plan to make the gobi manchurian tomorrow ðŸ¥° !
