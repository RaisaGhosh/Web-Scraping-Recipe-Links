# Pan fried noodles with chilli garlic vegetables

May 8, 2019 by Sheenam 11 Comments

Jump to Recipe*Print Recipe

Suuuuper crunchy noodles from the ouside, topped with a delicious chilli
garlic sauce with vegetables - these pan fried noodles are easier to make than
they look. All you need is a non stick wok (indian kadhai works too!) and
patience to not flip the noodles before 4.5 minutes!!!!

These brown golden parts of noodles that get _slightly_ soggy - just the right
amount of sogginess - with the chilli garlic vegetable sauce makes up for a
super delicious pan asian meal. We prepared our chilli garlic sauce using
Chilli Garlic dip by Aamra.

With real bits and pieces of red chilli and garlic, this was the perfect
choice for this recipe!!

  
  

You simply start by preparing the crispy pan fried noodles by heating oil in a
wok, carefully transferring the noodles to it.
