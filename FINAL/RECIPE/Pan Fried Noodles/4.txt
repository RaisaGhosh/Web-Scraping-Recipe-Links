Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times

Garlicky, gingery and as spicy as you dare to make it, this Asian-influenced
pan-fried noodle dish comes together in minutes. Most of the ingredients are
pantry staples, which means you can make it whenever you need a comforting
noodle dish that comes with a bite. If you can’t find the Chinese egg noodles
(also called Hong Kong-style noodles), you can make this with rice noodles or
soba. The key is to only boil them until they are halfway done. (They should
be pliable but still firm in the center.) They will finish cooking when you
pan-fry them.

### Preparation

  1. In a small bowl, combine the scallions, soy sauce, ginger, rice wine or vinegar, sesame oil and salt. Let stand while you prepare the noodles.
  2. In a large pot of boiling water, cook noodles until they are halfway done according to package instructions. (They should still be quite firm.) Drain well and toss with 1/2 tablespoon of the peanut oil to keep them from sticking, and spread them out on a plate or baking sheet.
  3. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of peanut oil. Add the garlic and cook until crisp and golden around the edges, 1 to 2 minutes. Add half the scallion mixture and stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add noodles; stir-fry until noodles are hot and lightly coated with sauce, about 30 seconds. Add eggs, spinach or edamame if using, sriracha, and remaining scallion mixture and continue to stir-fry until the eggs are cooked, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Garnish with cilantro and sesame seeds or peanuts.
