If you're looking to clear up any leftover ingredients you have left in your
fridge, give this Chicken Mei Fun a try! It's an incredibly versatile and
flexible dish where you can swap out the veggies or even the chicken with any
protein of your choice.

### Mei Fun or Bihun Goreng

Chicken Mei Fun is a Chinese stir fry dish that's traditionally made using
thin rice Mei Fun noodles such as rice vermicelli. And though it's a pretty
easy and simple dish where one just throws everything together, it's one of
those comforting meals that's rich, savory, and flavorful.

The bones of this dish is similar to the Malaysian-style noodle cult favorite
called _Bihun Goreng_ (aka _Mee Hoon Goreng_ ), which literally translates to
fried rice vermicelli noodles. However, certain bihun goreng recipes calls for
blended dried chilis ( _cili kisar_ ) for that spicy oomph that most
Malaysians love.

There's really no wrong time for you to enjoy it - be it for breakfast, lunch,
or dinner!

Another thing to note is the difference between this recipe and the one for
Singapore Mei Fun. The latter uses curry powder as its special ingredient that
lends to its beautiful bright yellow color.

### Notes for Chicken Mei Fun (Bihun Goreng)

  *  **Protein & Veggies **- Feel free to use any protein or vegetables you want. This is a great way to finish up those leftover veggies that you have in the fridge before it goes bad.
  *  **Don‚Äôt oversoak noodles** - Very important to not overcook/soak the noodles for too long or it will be too soft and break.
  *  **Toss noodles with chopsticks to prevent breakage** - Using tongs/spatula will usually cause the noodles to break. I find that the best way is to use chopsticks and lightly toss it. You can do so with two spatulas too. Do not over cook.
