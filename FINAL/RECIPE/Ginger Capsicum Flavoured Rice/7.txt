# Quick Butter Capsicum Rice

Quick Butter Capsicum Rice

Lately, I have been living off soups and cups of ginger tea as I'm nursing a
runny nose and sore throat. Feel a lot better today.

Yesterday we had chicken roast with a quick butter capsicum rice for our mid
day meal. The butter flavored rice had lot of crunch due to capsicum and
cashew nuts and it hardly needed any other ingredient to enhance its taste. A
quick one pot meal that is a total keeper!

3 cups of cooked long grained rice (each grain should be separate, add a tsp
of melted ghee to the rice and mix)

1 tbsp butter

1/2 tbsp ghee

1 tsp green chili paste

15 fresh curry leaves

I large capsicum/ green bell pepper, finely chopped

salt to taste

pepper pwd to taste

1/2 mustard seeds

1 tsp cumin seeds
