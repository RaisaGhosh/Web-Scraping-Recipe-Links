# Capsicum Rice

**Capsicum rice or Capsicum baath** is something I tasted in Mysore in one of
the several feasts which were a part of my cousin‚Äôs wedding. This was served
on the day after the wedding where just the family members from both the
bride‚Äôs and the groom‚Äôs side gathered for a final farewell. And what a meal it
was‚Ä¶the taste of this rice preparation lingered on and on‚Ä¶well after we
boarded the train to come back home. Some of them were lucky enough to get a
‚Äòpacket‚Äô of this to eat on the journey back.

In a few weeks, I was craving for this dish again. I had a bag of fresh
capsicums (green bell peppers) waiting to be made into a Capsicum rice. A word
of clarification regarding ‚Äòbaath‚Äô ‚Äì while it is pronounced just as you would
the English word ‚Äò **bath‚Äô.** It is a South Indian term for a mixed rice
preparation, which can be eaten as it is or with a ‚Äò **pachidi‚Äô** (raita). The
same recipe can be used to make Kathrikkai (Vaangi) Baath by just substituting
the capsicums with eggplants. You can try this eggplant millet dish prepared
along the lines of the Kathrikkai Bath.

The spices used in this are quite similar to my favourite Bisi Bele Baath
recipe blogged by Saakshi, which she says is an authentic Hebbar Iyengar
recipe.

**Capsicum rice is a perfect showcase of Indian spices**

Serves 4-6 people as the first course of the meal, which is concluded by Thair
Saadam üôÇ

Please do not be afraid of the long list of spices that is going to follow.
This recipe is a showcase of nearly a dozen Indian spices. The end result is
not at all overwhelming, but a beautiful way of showing how Indian spices
blend with each other.

## Capsicum Rice

This is a South Indian version of a Bell Pepper Pulao / Pilaf. A burst of
aroma is the characteristic of this dish, from the freshly toasted and ground
spices. Try this with plain yogurt or raita.

Prep Time 15 mins

Cook Time 30 mins

Total Time 45 mins

Course Main Course

Cuisine south indian

Servings 4 serving

### Ingredients

  * 1 1/2 cups rice jeera rice or pulao rice variety
  * 5 large green bell peppers medium dice
  * 1/4 cup peanuts
  * 1 tbsp coconut oil
  * 1/2 tsp mustard seeds
  * 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
  * 2 tsps salt

#### For Spice Mix

  * 1/2 tsp coconut oil
  * 4 chillies large dried red
  * 2 tbsps chana dal (Split skinned Bengal gram dal)
  * 1 tbsp dal udad
  * handful coriander seeds
  * 1 tsp cumin seeds
  * 1/2 tsp black pepper corns whole
  * one 4 inchs cinnamon long sticks
  * 5 - 6 cloves
  * 1 cardamom green
  * 2 bay leaves
  * 2 tbsps sesame seeds
  * 1/4 cup coconut grated (fresh or dried)
  * 1 tbsp jaggery (optional)
  * 1 tbsp tamarind (soaked in water for 10 minutes)

### Instructions

  * To prepare capsicum rice, start with cooking the rice. Pressure cook the picked and washed rice with 3 cups water, for 2-3 whistles. Switch off and cool.

  * Preparing the capsicum: In a wok, heat a tbsp of oil. Splutter the mustard and cumin seeds. Add the peanuts. Saute for 2 minutes till they change colour. Then add in the diced capsicum, on a low-medium flame, stir fry till the capsicum is softened but still a little crisp.

  * Preparing the spice mix for the capsicum rice :While the capsicum is cooking on a low flame, heat another wok on the other burner. Heat oil and add the spices (red chilli through bay leaves - reserving the coconut and sesame seeds). Continuously saute on a low flame till the dals turn lightly golden and everything begins to release its aroma (around 7 minutes) . Remove and cool.

  * In the same wok, lightly toast the grated coconut till fragrant - around 2 minutes. Remove onto the above dish.

  * Next toast the sesame seeds. When they start popping (in around 2 minutes), remove them too.

  * In a mixer, pulse all the above toasted items along with the soaked tamarind and jaggery, till you get a coarse powder.

  * Assembling the baath:In a large deep dish, remove the cooked rice and cool for 10 minutes, separating with a fork if necessary.

  * Over this add the capsicum-peanut mix as well as the coarsely powdered spice mix, with adequate salt (around 2 tsp). Toss lightly with clean fingertips, until the rice is uniformly coated with the spices and the vegetable mix. Check for salt and adjust accordingly.

### Notes

**Notes:**

This is best prepared 3-4 hours in advance of the meal, as the flavours are at
their very best after few hours of sitting around.

Our accompanying **raita** was made from **golden pumpkin** , finely chopped,
microwave cooked, mashed and mixed with yogurt and a standard mustard-curry
leaf tempering. You can also do a ripe-banana raita or a simple cucumber
raita. Take care to keep the raita simple and spice-free as the rice is
already brimming with spices.

Pin

Next and final course was **Thair Saadam** , which needs no introduction to
any Indian. The quintessential **yogurt and rice** without which no
traditional meal ends in Tamil-land. For a daily meal, rice and yogurt are
mixed with deft fingers and eaten with a **pickle** or **sambar** (if leftover
from the first course). On some special days, yogurt rice is brought pre-mixed
to the table with a delicate tempering.

I used half broken wheat and half rice for this preparation today (no special
reason). Mash with plenty of yogurt (half milk and half yogurt if you are
going to leave it out to sour, or lots of milk and tiny bit of yogurt if it is
going to be consumed after several hours as the milk will set to curd along
with the rice, and our Tamil grannies know how to time this to perfection).

Season with salt.

In a tadka ladle or small wok, heat a tsp of oil. Add bits of minced green
chillies, bits of minced fresh ginger, mustard seeds, curry leaves and a pinch
of asafoetida. Turn over into the yogurt rice. Give a stir.

Serve chilled with your favourite pickle. (My current favourite is Tomato
Thokku from Grand Sweets)

I make the pumpkin pachadi often but never ate capsicum bhaath. I suppose the
taste is similar to tondli bhaat. Only difference caps taste yummier than
tondlis:) The dishes look good as always:)

Hi, I‚Äôve been visiting your blog for sometime now. And finally decided to
comment. That is called Vaangi-baath in Karnataka and is super popular. Your
post brought memories of my granny making this for us. We are TamBrams but we
always had this. Now, in the US, with meagre cooking skills, I miss it all.
Sigh.Thanks Nandita!

This lunch series is turning out to be really wonderful Nandita! Love it üôÇ I
want to come to your place for lunch every day‚Ä¶ :(Sometimes I make just the
thair saadam for a meal :)) But I add diced cucumber, carrots and onions to
it, not forgetting the mor-milagai in the tadka :DThe cabbage curry in the
prev post looks perfect! Hardly any color change. My mom makes it the exact
same way, this method of making veggies is surely the best of all.

Looks great! SLight terminology related objection ‚Äì ‚Äúbaath‚Äù?!! It could be
‚Äúsaadam‚Äù, even ‚Äúbhaath‚Äù (actually no ‚Äì bhaath is not a tamilian word).Just
kidding. Great recipe. ‚ÄìDeepa

Happycook- sure, you are welcome, we always love company for food :)Sunshine-
I chanced upon ur blog just today, happy to find another food blogger in
Bombay.Nandini ‚Äì thanks for taking time to write back üôÇ Vaangi baath is the
original, but me no big fan of brinjals so capsicum it is for me!Priya ‚Äì you
welcome dear! Adding tons of veggies is good if thair sadam is the one meal,
makes it more nutritious and filling! Mor molagai is the ultimate combo though
:)Deepa- may be baath is not a word, but colloquially that‚Äôs how it is! Since
it is not a real Tambram recipe as such, it is not called sadam‚Ä¶you might be
familiar with vaangi-baath (that‚Äôs how it is called in the South) whereas a
Maharashtrian would call it Vaangi-bhaath. Tamil language has no ‚Äòbha‚Äô
alphabet, it is just ‚Äòpa‚Äô which is used interchangably with ‚Äòba‚Äô ‚Äì that‚Äôs why
the ‚Äòbaath‚Äô I guess üôÇ

Hello Nandita, I have been visiting your blog regularly for the past month and
I think your recipes are healthy tasty and very innovative !! I am a tambram
too and I love to cook though I rarely venture out of the traditional cooking
boundaries.

I am a ‚Äúno fan of brinjal‚Äù too and I think I would give this recipe a shot for
sure. The tomato thokku from Grand sweets is just awesome ‚Äì have you tried
their ginger thokku? I am still deciding which one I like better:)

  9. Sumi says: June 4, 2008 at 5:51 pm

Heyyy, Even I dont like Vaangi Baath but love the capsicum version of it, and
also I love Grand sweets Tomato Thokku and Thayir sadam! Yeah, even if I eat
111 stuffs I dont feel its complete without eating thayir sadam, the highlight
of Tambram recipes.Thanks for sharing, Nandita!

Aparna ‚Äì Glad you enjoying the series‚Ä¶Well I rarely get into a traditional
cooking spree, hence this blogging effort, so as to preserve these recipes‚Ä¶I‚Äôm
too busy trying out stuff from around the country and the world that our own
cuisine seems so lovely and exotic to me :)Akay- it is called tomato pickle on
the bottle‚Ä¶i haven‚Äôt tried ginger, only two i have tasted often are this one
and the curry leaf pickle‚Ä¶Sumi ‚Äì LOL @ your comment :)ET ‚Äì Hope you like what

üôÇ Nandita, we hate brinjal at home too. So Pati made it with Capsicum and
peas. Add peas to it and watch how the taste goes way beyond what you
expected. Also, we make this spice powder every month or so. So, sometimes,
its just yummy curry with the powder and eat with Thair saadam! Yummy!

Reply

  15. nandita says: June 5, 2008 at 2:00 pm

Nandini ‚Äì Thanks for the idea, will SURELY add peas next time‚Ä¶and your idea of
making this powder in a jar for instant use is just perfect‚Ä¶did not get your
last line..you mean we can eat this powder ‚Äòas is‚Äô with thair saadam??

  16. Nandini Vishwanath says: June 5, 2008 at 2:20 pm

Yay! You came to my blog. LOL. Thanks, Nandita, and about the powder ‚Äì use

Hi N,Totally love your blog! I‚Äôm a foodie and visiting this is a sure shot
recipe for foiling any attempts at losing weight!I am glad you mentioned thair
sadam. It‚Äôs one of the most underrated foods.Back in TN, Tam-brams are called
‚ÄòThair sadams‚Äô but I‚Äôve become one after moving to Mumbai. It‚Äôs the ultimate
comfort food! My MIL makes one version with beaten rice that‚Äôs superlative ‚Äì
you also toss in a couple of fried ‚Äòmor mozhagas‚Äô with the tempering. Wish I
was as interested in making stuff as much as eating it!

The comment from anonymous is startling, I saw it in another recipe as well.
Totally unconnected and strange. Lunch series 4 is super awesome .. yes,
Karnataka ‚Äì esp mysore and bangalore is defntly a veggies place and offers
sooper dooper great food. Nice recipe for Capsicum bath and yes when replaced
with eggplants ‚Äì this becomes Vangi bath üôÇ It is also served during weddings.
Thanks for enlightening me on the pumpkin raitha üôÇ will try that out for sure.
And yes, hebbar (may be not hebbal .. from my 5 years stay in Bangalore)
iyengars are very famous for their baaths, bisi bele bath and puliyogare.. so
are melkote iyengars. They are just out of the world in perfection and taste.
Great lunch combi .. must say my fav after lunch series 1 and 3 üôÇ

Hey nandita the bath looks very inviting. Reminds me of my bangalore days
where every vegetable gets bath-ed if you know what i mean. And its hebbar
iyengar or not hebbal. Hebbal is a place in bangalore
