November 30, 2018 by maria 39 Comments

**Butter Garlic Prawns** **Recipe** with step by step photos, which is one of
my favorite dish. I had eaten this at a joint at Bandra with my friend. I am
glad she took me there otherwise I wouldn't have made an attempt today to make
this mouthwatering recipe :)â€¦.One of the most _delicious, easiest, fastest
recipe made with least ingredients_ is this prawns recipe. My family loved it
including my naughty pet. Do try this Butter Garlic Prawns as it will surely
melt in your mouth! Also the light spices in this recipe gives nice flavor and
juice to the Prawns so don't add any extra masala to this _Butter Garlic
Prawns!_

We picked up some biz sized prawns today. Also I was telling my mom I wanted
to make this Butter Garlic Prawns from a long time. So I took this bright
opportunity to make this awesome dish.

You can eat Butter Garlic Prawns as a side starter, with garlic cheese bread,
appams Or just pop in your mouth. For a person like me I can also eat with
bread, rotis or steamed rice ðŸ˜‰

I am surely gonna prepare this recipe again but with a different version. This
dish is not _ **defined to any region, area or caste**_. Its a free recipe
with ingredients found across earth and anyone can make them easily.

## Let's make step by step Butter Garlic Prawns with pepper:

1\. Take Fresh Prawns clean them under tap water. Clean the Prawns remove the
black thread which is the spine of prawns. Now keep them aside with some salt
mixed in it. Wash the prawns again. Also please keep the head and tail intact
of prawns as it looks beautiful with them.

2\. Take a pan or wok add olive oil+butter. Keep the gas on medium heat add
chopped garlic.

3\. Saute them for a minute. Add rock salt and black pepper as desired.

4\. Its time to add cleaned and washed prawns. Saute gently all.

5\. Cover the pan with a lid for 2 to 3 mins on low heat. Keep stirring in
between else it might stick at the bottom.

6\. Remove the lid and keep the heat on medium mode. Check once prawns are
cooked Squeeze Lime juice on it.

Hi Maria, we too fell in love with this dish when we had it at a restaurant.
Iâ€™m glad to have found this recipe as it tastes exactly the same. Iâ€™ve been
making it over the last few years. My kids do not like to have prawns any
other way. They simply love this one.

Yes Zafreena you can try with chicken as well but chicken takes a longer time
to cook then prawns so take care of that part.

Love those big chunks of garlic with that buttery shrimp-Yum! I would have to
have them over rice or with bread to tame my appetite, otherwise I would eat
too many. Thanks for sharing, friend!
