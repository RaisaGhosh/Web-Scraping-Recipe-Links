Chili Garlic Noodles with lots of garlic and a kick from the chili make the
perfect weeknight dinner.

Serve them as such or pair with a stir-fry for a comforting meal! Vegan.

I can pretty much eat noodles everyday of my life and not get bored.

What about you guys? Do you guys share my love for noodles?

I like them in all flavors and forms, my love for noodles is far from being
biased.

These Chili Garlic Noodles are one of my favorite ways to enjoy them. There
are a lot of veggies, lots of garlic and lots of flavors, what't not to like?

The good thing about these noodles is that they are also easy to put together.

You would need some time to do all the chopping but once that's done, these
come together in like 15 minutes!

## These Chili Garlic Noodles

âœ”are easy to make for a weeknight meal.

âœ”can be served as such or paired with a stir-fry or manchurian.

âœ”vegan and can be made gluten-free by using gluten-free soy sauce.

âœ”have a lot of flavor from all the sauces and tons of garlic.

Since the name of these noodles is chili garlic, they obviously have a lot of
garlic and also have some heat.

Keep in mind that they are still not super spicy since I can't eat very spicy
food.

So, I used only 1 tablespoon of hot sauce and 1 jalapeÃ±o in the recipe. If you
want these to be spicier, you can double the hot sauce.

For extra garlic flavor, I have used 2 tablespoons of grated garlic. Do not
skimp on this, do use the quantity mentioned since you want a prominent garlic
flavor in these noodles.

The veggies used are onions, carrots, peppers. You can use snap peas or even
broccoli would be good here. Addition of some crisp tofu will be good too.

These are just some of the variables that you can try here.

The sauce for these noodles is pretty basic. It has soy sauce, sambal oelek
(you can use sriracha also), rice vinegar, salt and pepper.

I also add some sugar to balance out the flavors but it is optional and you
may skip it.

## How to Make The Perfect Noodles?

Whenever you are making noodles like this, consider keeping few things in
mind.

**Don 't overcook the noodles**- boil them until they are like 70% cooked. You
want them to have a nice bite. They will cook more once you add them to the
wok along with the sauce and the veggies. So do not cook them completely while
boiling.

That will result in mushy noodles and nobody likes them.

**Toss the boiled noodles in some oil** - this will prevent the noodles from
sticking. Usually I add around 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of oil and toss the noodles
around once they are boiled.

**Slice the veggies thin** - that will give them more flavor! Slice them
really thin for this recipe.

**Have everything chopped and ready to go** - since we are cooking on high
heat, it makes it much easier when you have everything chopped and ready to be
added to the wok.

**Finish off with some toasted sesame oil** - or you can even use some chili
oil. This gives the noodles extra flavor.

Hope you guys would give these chili garlic noodles a try and enjoy them!

These pair well with any Indo chinese recipes.

## Method

Chop everything before you start. Since we are going to cook on high heat,
it's important to have everything ready to go.



1- Boil noodles according to instructions on the package. I was supposed to
boil mine for 3 to 4 minutes only.

Once boiled, drain the noodles using a colander and then toss the noodles with
1/2 tablespoon oil so that they don't stick. Set aside.

2- Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok on medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot,
add the grated garlic and saute for 30 seconds or so on high heat until it
starts changing color.

3- Then add the sliced onion and jalapeÃ±o (or use green chilies) and toss to
combine. Cook for around 1-2 minutes stirring often.

4- Then add the sliced red pepper and carrots. Mix to combine and cook for 2
more minutes on high heat.

5- Lower the heat and push veggies to the side. Then add the soy sauce, hot
sauce (like sambal oelek), rice vinegar, sugar (optional), black pepper and
salt. Mix well.

6- Stir in the boiled noodles.

7- Toss to combine the noodles with the sauce and the veggies. Use a fork and
a spoon or a pair of tongs to mix everything together. Cook for another minute
or so.

8- Add toasted sesame oil and mix. Turn off heat and garnish with green
onions.

Serve chili garlic noodles warm with chilli paneer or gobi manchurian!

Set aside.

### Notes

  1. The noodles that I have used here are thin noodles that I got from a local restaurant that used these noodles to make hakka noodles. Use any thin wheat noodles, Chings brand hakka noodles are good too. 
  2. Add more of the hot sauce for spicier noodles.
  3. Use tamari in place of soy sauce to make these gluten-free.
