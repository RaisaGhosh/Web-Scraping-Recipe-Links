# Instant Pot Green Chicken Curry (Hariyali Chicken)

February 5, 2020

157 Comments

Jump to Recipe

This green chicken curry is a _pour and cook_ recipe! Blend a handful of
ingredients together in a food processor or blender, pour the sauce over
chicken, and cook!

Green chicken masala is light and lemony and herby. It's very different from
the more common tomato-based Indian curries that you might be used to eating.

This dish is really easy to make. I've been working on coming up with more
pour and cook recipes, and this one (like all the rest) requires very little
effort and happens to be big on flavor.

## What's Green Chicken Curry/Hariyali Chicken?

This green chicken curry goes by a few names: hariyali chicken, green chicken
masala, and green chutney chicken. There's a chance I may have made up that
last one (green chutney chicken). I'm not actually sure anyone calls it that
except for me, lol.

Hariyali chicken is typically made two ways: as a dry preparation, which is
how you'll often find it served at Indian parties (hariyali chicken tikka), or
as a curry where chicken is simmered in a verdant sauce (hariyali chicken
masala) and served over rice or with roti. The recipe I'm sharing today is a
curry.

Also, for those who've never heard the word hariyali, it just means
"greenery." And clearly, there's quite a bit of greenery in this. The main
ingredients: cilantro, mint, yogurt, lemon, spices, and cashews.

Cashews aren't typically used in this dish, but I like the nuttiness and the
touch of creaminess they add to the sauce. I've made this without nuts too,
and it's still good, a bit thinner, though. If you can't have nuts, leave them
out, or maybe try it with unsweetened shredded coconut? Or white poppy seeds,
or sesame seeds? I'm just thinking (writing?) out loudâ€¦ ðŸ¤”

### Ingredients



  * â–¢ 1 Â½ pounds boneless and skinless chicken thighs
  * â–¢ 1 bunch cilantro including stems
  * â–¢ 1 small bunch mint leaves*
  * â–¢ Â¼ cup raw cashews
  * â–¢ Â¼ cup water
  * â–¢ 2 tablespoons lemon juice
  * â–¢ 2 tablespoons yogurt
  * â–¢ 2- inch ginger
  * â–¢ 4 garlic cloves
  * â–¢ 1 serrano pepper
  * â–¢ 1 teaspoon salt
  * â–¢ Â½ teaspoon amchur powder dried green mango powder
  * â–¢ Â½ teaspoon garam masala
  * â–¢ Â½ teaspoon turmeric

### Instructions



  * Add the chicken to the instant pot.

  * Blend the remaining ingredients in a food processor or blender then pour this over the chicken.

  * Secure the lid, close the pressure valve and cook for 5 minutes at high pressure.

  * Naturally release pressure or wait 10 minutes then release pressure.

  * Using two forks, shred the chicken right into the curry.

### Notes

*I typically use a small packet (.5 ounces) of mint as that's what my grocery store usually has available. More or less mint is fine.

I have only tested this recipe with chicken thighs, if you substitute chicken
breasts you may need to add more water as the fat from the thighs helps
prevent burning.

Hi, sounds like great recipe. Does it really fully cook the chicken in 5
minutes? I donâ€™t have an instapot but do have crockpot. Any tips on cooking in
crockpot? My crockpot does have pressure cooking setting but Iâ€™ve never used.
I normally slow cook everything in the crockpot. Open to any suggestions you
may have. Thanks!!

Hi Jim, yes, the pressure cooker cooks it much faster than it would take on
the stovetop or in a crockpot. What kind of crockpot is it? I'm sure this
would be fine to slow cook as well.

Fantastic! It's fresh and lively tasting, and easy to make! I also love that
it doesn't use tomatoes. I have made this several times now, and everyone I
have served this to has loved it! My only challenge is that I get the burn
message every time i make it, even though I used extra water. Next time I will
double the water to see if that helps.

Emily, I'm so glad you like this! Sorry to hear about the burn sign - are you
using a 6 quart? And are you using chicken thighs (the fat helps prevent
burning)? Let me know, would love to troubleshoot!

Thank you for your reply!  
There are so many variables! I think the issue was two fold: the sauce was too
thick, and I *think* my pot is having some trouble coming to pressure. I made
the recipe again just two days ago and I added less cilantro so the color was
more similar to yours, and I made sure to use raw nuts instead of roasted. And
i added about 50% more water.

I also wonder if the chicken from my natural food store just doesn't have as
much water as other brands? I have used thighs each time, but two days ago I
made it again with Trader Joe's chicken thighs and there was a lot more water.
I didn't get a burn message, but it's partly because I opened it up to preempt
it, as it was still taking a long time to come to pressure. It still turned
out great! The smell is amazing!

Single dad here. Made this for my kids and they absolutely loved it. We had a
few friends over last week, and the kids asked for this again - it went like a
dream. Canâ€™t wait to try some of the other recipes here; perhaps egg curry
this weekend.

Would this green masala freeze well? Given it would be raw ingredients, I
wasn't too sure.

Hi Miko, I make and freeze green chutney all the time and this is really
similar so I'm sure it'd be fine to make ahead and freeze the green masala.
I'll have to try that myself sometime - it's a good idea ðŸ™‚

I made this for dinner tonight and it was incredible! Full disclosure though I
did double the garam masala and turmeric and I added a few extra cashews. I
also added large chunks of green capsicum for some extra veggies. This is
definitely going to be a staple in our house - even my notoriously pick
husband loved it! I think we may try making it next time with soya chunks
instead of chicken for a vegetarian option.

Amazing! I've made different hariyali chicken recipes before and this one
really stands out because of the use of amchur and lemon juice. It made the
flavor profile so much more complex and rich.

Hi Ashley,

I tried your recipe today. I did not have some thighs so I used chicken legs.
I did not have either the amchur powder and substituted anything for it.
Otherwise, I followed your recipe (no burn message for me). It was light and
delicious. Love your idea pour and cook recipes so easy to make.

Do you think that your recipe can be made with another type of meat, such as
lamb?

Thank you!

Hi Francoise, I'm so glad you liked this recipe ðŸ™‚ I haven't tried this with
lamb but I think it'll work! If you try, please let me know how it goes!

April 20, 2021 at 1:56 pm

I will Ashley thank you! But I just want your advice, do you think it will be
the same time in cooking because your recipes for lamb usually require more
time for cooking? Thank you for your help!

Hi Francoise, I would try 6 minutes with a full natural release (I think 5
minutes with NPR would probably work too). I'm able to cook lamb in my lamb
biryani in 6 minutes with NPR, so I think it'll work here too ðŸ™‚

Do your Instapot recipes turn out equally well in both 3 quart and 6 quart
pots? I have a 3 quart instapot but don't want to try your recipes and waste
ingredients if your recipes are not designed for a 3 quart size pot.

All of my recipes are tested using a 6 quart instant pot. I've heard that some
people have successfully made my recipes in a 3 qt but I can't say for sure.
You can always ask in my facebook group - someone may be able to help!

Your easy, healthy, and flavor-packed Indian instant pot recipes are
delightful! This one tastes so fresh and verdant. I like to call it green
chutney chicken too ðŸ™‚ It is on the menu again for next week. I am very glad I
picked up your cookbook a few years ago! Thank you!
