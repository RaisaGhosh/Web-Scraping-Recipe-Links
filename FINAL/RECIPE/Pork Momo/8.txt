## ingredients

Nutrition

  * ###  Dough for wrappers 

  * 4  cups all-purpose flour
  * 1  tablespoon oil
  * water, as required 
  * 1  pinch salt
  * ###  Filling 

  * 2  lbs lean ground meat (50% lamb or chicken & 50% pork works best)
  * 1  cup red onion, finely chopped 
  * 1⁄2 cup green onion, finely chopped 
  * 1  cup ripe tomatoes, finely chpped 
  * 3  tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped 
  * 1  tablespoon fresh garlic, minced 
  * 1  tablespoon fresh ginger, minced 
  * 1⁄4 teaspoon nutmeg, freshly grated 
  * 1⁄2 teaspoon turmeric
  * 1  tablespoon curry powder, or momo masala if available 
  * 3  fresh red chilies, minced (or to taste)
  * 3  tablespoons cooking oil
  * salt and pepper

## directions

  * Dough: In a large bowl combine flour, oil, salt and water.
  * Mix well, knead until the dough becomes homogeneous in texture, about 8-10 minute.
  * Cover and let stand for at least 30 minute.
  * Knead well again before making wrappers.
  * Filling: In a large bowl combine all filling ingredients.
  * Mix well, adjust for seasoning with salt and pepper.
  * Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour to allow all ingredients to impart their unique flavors.
  * This also improves the consistency of the filling.
  * ### Assembly:

  * Give the dough a final knead.
  * Prepare 1-in. dough balls.
  * Take a ball, roll between your palms to spherical shape.
  * Dust working board with dry flour.
  * On the board gently flatten the ball with your palm to about 2-in circle.
  * Make a few semi-flattened circles, cover with a bowl.
  * Use a rolling pin to roll out each flattened circle into a wrapper.
  * For well executed MOMO's, it is essential that the middle portion of the wrapper be slightly thicker than the edges to ensure the structural integrity of dumplings during packing and steaming.
  * Hold the edges of the semi-flattened dough with one hand and with the other hand begin rolling the edges of the dough out, swirling a bit at a time.
  * Continue until the wrapper attains 3-in diameter circular shape.
  * Repeat with the remaining semi-flattened dough circles.
  * Cover with bowl to prevent from drying.
  * For packing hold wrapper on one palm, put one tablespoon of filling mixture and with the other hand bring all edges together to the center, making the pleats.
  * Pinch and twist the pleats to ensure the absolute closure of the stuffed dumpling.
  * This holds the key to good tasting, juicy dumplings.
  * Heat up a steamer, oil the steamer rack well.
  * This is critical because it will prevent dumplings from sticking.
  * Arrange uncooked dumplings in the steamer.
  * Close the lid, and allow steaming until the dumplings are cooked through, about 10 minutes.
  * Take dumplings off the steamer and serve immediately.
  * Alternatively, you can place uncooked dumplings directly in slightly salted boiling water and cook until done, approximately 10 minutes. Be careful not to over boil the dumplings.
  * You may also slightly sauté cooked dumplings in butter before serving.
  * To serve, arrange the cooked dumplings (MOMO's) on serving plate with hot tomato achar or any other chutneys as condiment.

I don’t see the cooking instructions for the filling for the Nepali Momos? I’m
guessing that all the ingredients are put into a pot and cooked all together.
But for how long? I’m cooking it for the first time tonight.
