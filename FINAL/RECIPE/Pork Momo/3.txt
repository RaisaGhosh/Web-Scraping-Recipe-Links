  * 200 gm Cabbage finely chopped
  * 2 bunches Scallions [green onions] finely chopped, white part only
  * 1 thumbsize Ginger minced
  * 2 1/2  tablespoon Salt
  * 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder – ½ optional

#### Dough

  * 6 cups Flour white, all purpose, or whole wheat
  * 3 1/2 cups Warm water

#### Sauce

  * 500 gm Tomatoes ripe
  * 1 tablespoon Hog plum powder lapsiko dhulo
  * 1 medium sized Red onion sliced
  * 1 bunch Cilantro, coriander leaves roughly chopped
  * 1 tablespoon Fennel seeds toasted and ground
  * 2 teaspoons Black pepper powder
  * 1 tablespoon Chili powder
  * 3 tablespoon Sesame oil
  * 1 tablespoon Vegetable oil
  * 1 1/2 teaspoon Salt
  * 1 1/2 tablespoon Water

### Instructions



  * Prepare filling ingredients, dumpling dough, and tomato sauce by following the recipe shown below.

  * Divide the dumpling dough into roughly 12 individual balls.

  * Roll them out into 1-inch thick logs, cut each log into 6-8 pieces. Press each piece into thick coins by the palm of your hand.

  * Roll each coin into round shapes of 3-inch diameter and ¼ cm thick.

  * Meanwhile, fill the dumpling pot with 2-3 inches of water. Start boiling them.

  * Fill each rolled dough with ½ tablespoon of filling. Moisten the edges with water, shape them how you desire, seal the edges, and place them on a greased steamer basket or floured surface until ready to cook.

  * Steam dumplings for 20 minutes in high heat.

  * Serve momos with hog plum and tomato sauce.

#### Dough

  * Put the flour in a bowl and make a well in the center.

  * Pour the water in the center and mix with a wooden spatula or by hand.

  * Knead the dough for around 3 minutes, add more water by the teaspoon if necessary.

  * Bring all the lumps into a softball, wrap with a kitchen towel and leave to rest for at least 10 minutes.

#### Sauce

  * In a pot, heat up vegetable oil, fry the onions until translucent.

  * Add tomatoes, cook for a minute.

  * Add the rest of the ingredients except sesame oil and cilantro.

  * Simmer the sauce while covered for 20 minutes, stir in every couple of minutes.

  * Blend all ingredients together until puree.

### Notes

  * Nepalese people are eating momos for centuries, probably the best food like daal, bhat ….etc. The recipe shown above is somewhat a local-style momo at the Nepalese streets and restaurants. Even though, every Nepali claims they make the best momos.
  * There are various shapes and sizes of momos, anyone can create their own desired shapes. The only thing matter is to properly seal them to prevent them from bursting while cooking.
  * Uncooked momos can be kept frozen for several weeks. In order to freeze them, put them on a sheet pan or a flat plate and freeze them. After frozen, store them in zip lock bags. Preparing momos is a time-consuming work. That is why freezing uncooked momos and sauce are recommended. Leftover marinated fillings should be consumed within 24 hours. They go bad quickly.
  * Momos can be steamed, Pan-seared also known Kothay style, or prepared as dumpling soups.
