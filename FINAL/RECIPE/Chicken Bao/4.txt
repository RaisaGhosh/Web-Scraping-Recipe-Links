Crispy Chicken Bao Buns with Asian Slaw

  * Prep time: 25
  * Calories: 670

A long time Chinese favourite, bao are steamed buns that are usually filled
with succulent meat. In this recipe, crispy chicken and Korean style bao helps
to create tasty sliders. Steaming the buns gives them an irresistible soft
bite which contrasts the crunchy cucumber. A colourful slaw provides a healthy
addition to this dinner. Enjoy #youplateit.
