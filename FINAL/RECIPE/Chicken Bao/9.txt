Serves

Makes 6 buns

## Ingredients

### For the buns

  * 200g/7oz self-raising flour, plus extra for rolling
  * 2 tbsp caster sugar
  * 1½ tsp baking powder
  * 100ml/3½fl oz full-fat milk
  * 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
  * 1 tbsp sunflower oil, plus 1–2 tsp for coating the dough
  * pinch fine sea salt

### For the chicken

  * 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat
  * 1 tbsp light soy sauce
  * 1 tsp sesame oil
  * 1 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted
  * handful fresh coriander, thinly sliced red chilli and finely sliced spring onions, to serve

### For the sticky sauce

  * 1½ tbsp light soy sauce
  * 1½ tbsp dark soy sauce
  * 1 tbsp harissa paste
  * 1 tsp white wine vinegar
  * 1 tbsp runny honey
  * 1 tsp sesame oil

## Method

  1. To make the buns, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a freestanding mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix the milk, vinegar and oil together in a jug and slowly add to the mixer. Mix on a low setting until the dough comes together, then increase the speed to the highest setting and knead for 4–5 minutes, or until the dough is very smooth and elastic. (You can also mix the dough in a bowl and then knead on a very lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes.)

  2. Divide the bun dough into 6 portions and roll into balls. Place one of the balls on a surface lightly dusted with flour and roll into an oval shape, 4-5mm thick and roughly the size of a large mobile phone. Rub the surface with a little of the sunflower oil and fold in half. Make 5 more buns in the same way.

  3. A third fill a large saucepan or wok with water and bring to a simmer. If using a saucepan, it needs to be big enough to fit a large steamer (roughly 25cm in diameter) snugly on top. Line the steamer basket with a circle of baking parchment. Place 3 buns in the steamer basket and place over the simmering water. Cover with the lid and steam for about 8 minutes, or until the buns are well risen, light and fluffy. Put to one side while the remaining 3 buns are cooked.

  4. While the buns are steaming, preheat a griddle pan over a high heat. Mix the chicken thighs with the soy sauce and sesame oil and massage well into the meat. Place on the hot griddle, opened out so they cook quickly. Griddle the chicken for about 5 minutes on each side, or until completely cooked through. If you don’t have a griddle pan, you can grill the chicken on a foil-lined tray.

  5. Mix all the ingredients for the sticky sauce together in a jug and pour over the chicken in the griddle. Cook for 20-30 seconds, turning the chicken until well coated with the bubbling sauce. Transfer to a board, sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and slice thickly. (If grilling, you can return the chicken to the grill for a further 2-3 minutes.)

  6. Put the buns on a board or serving platter and open up. Fill with the sticky chicken, fresh coriander and spring onions. Serve with lime wedges and finely sliced chillies
