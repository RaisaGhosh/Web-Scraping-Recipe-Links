#  Dungeness Crab With Sichuan Pepper Salt & Aromatics

## November 26, 2015Hsiao-Ching Chou

**Author's Note:** For the month of November, I am participating in NaBloPoMo
(National Blog Post Month) and pledge to post once a day.

## I love Dungeness crab. But I'm more accustomed to eating it hot and fresh
out of the wok â€“ not chilled. After boiling crab, toss the clusters in the wok
with Sichuan peppercorn-salt, green onions, ginger, garlic, shallots, chiles
and cilantro. By the time you've finished shelling a piece of crab, you _will_
lick your fingers.

This summer, we spent a long weekend on Camano Island and had the good fortune
to be able to go crabbing. It was a banner catch and we had to come up with
different ways to prepare the crab: chilled and dipped in butter; mixed in a
soup; and, of course, stir-fried.

Crabbing on Camano, early summer 2015.

One of my favorite preparations is salt-and-pepper crab. Every cook has a
slight variation on the combination of aromatics. I created my version based
on what I had on hand.

Clockwise from top right: minced ginger, chopped green onions, crushed garlic,
finely diced jalapenos, chopped fresh cilantro, and (center) shallots.

**DUNGENESS CRAB STIR-FRIED WITH AROMATICS**  
SERVES 4 AS A COURSE

2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
2 tablespoons crushed fresh garlic  
2 stalks green onions, finely chopped  
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger  
1 medium shallot, finely chopped  
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro  
1 jalapeno, seeded and finely diced  
1 teaspoon kosher salt  
1 teaspoon freshly ground Sichuan peppercorn (see Note)  
3 Dungeness crab, cleaned and boiled, and segmented

Clean and boil the crab just before you're ready to stir fry. (If you do cook
the crab in advance and chill it, you will need to stir fry the crab a little
longer to heat all the way through.)

Heat wok over high heat. Add the vegetable oil and let heat for about 5-10
seconds. Add the garlic, green onions, ginger, shallots, cilantro and
jalapenos. Quickly stir fry all the aromatics for about 30 seconds. Add the
crab legs and toss with the seasonings. You may have to turn the heat down to
medium as you toss all the seasonings with the crab. It may require you to use
a spatula in one hand and tongs in the other to incorporate all the
ingredients. Sprinkle the salt and Sichuan peppercorns. Toss again and serve.

 **Note** : Toast about 1 1/2 tablespoons whole Sichuan peppercorns in a
skillet over medium heat for about 1 minute. Shake the pan to keep the pepper
from burning. Grind in a spice grinder.
