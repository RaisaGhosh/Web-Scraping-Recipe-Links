In this exotic dish, melt-in-the-mouth tofu is combined with crunchy and juicy
veggies and flavoured with black bean sauce. Red chilli roundels add to the
spice quotient of the Tofu in Black Bean Sauce making it a truly rare treat.  
  
The black bean sauce gives the dish a fabulous flavour that you will
thoroughly enjoy. Even though we have used firm tofu, it is still very soft
and must be handled with care.  
  
You can also try making the Tofu, Broccoli and Red Cabbage Stir Fry and the
Chinese Barbequed Tofu with Sesame Noodles .

This is a tasty dish, although I made some adjustments. I fried the tofu and
did not add any salt because the black bean and soy sauce are salty.
Additionally, I added fresh ginger when cooking the onions and peppers in
sasame oil. Great.
