## Ingredients

1 pack of **Cauldron Organic Tofu**  
3 tbsp oil  
1 inch of ginger, finely chopped  
6 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal  
150 g green beans, trimmed and cut in half  
3 tbsp fermented black beans  
2 cloves of garlic, crushed  
½ tbsp dried chilli flakes  
1 tbsp shaoxing rice wine  
2 tbsp soy sauce  
1 tbsp maple syrup  
3 tbsp cornflour  
½ tsp white pepper

## Method

  1. Drain the tofu for 20 minutes by placing it in-between two chopping boards lined with a clean tea towel or kitchen roll. Put something heavy on top, e.g. food cans, to apply pressure.
  2. Once the tofu has been pressed, chop in half, and slice each half into 8 strips. Mix the cornflour with the white pepper and dust each slice of tofu with it. Place a pan onto a medium-high heat with one tablespoon of oil. Fry the tofu for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Set aside. # Place a wok on a high heat and add the remaining oil to the pan. Once hot, add the ginger, spring onions, green beans and dried fermented black beans. Fry for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
  3. Add the tofu to the wok with the garlic, dried chilli flakes, shaoxing rice wine, soy sauce and maple syrup. Cook for a further 4-5 minutes, making sure all ingredients in the pan are moving at all times. Add water as needed.
  4. Serve with soba noodles.
