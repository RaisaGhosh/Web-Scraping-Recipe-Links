Chow Mein is a Chinese stir fried noodles dish. Chinese cuisine is very
popular in India and there are lots of variants of vegetarian Chinese
delicacies. This is a delicious preparation for vegetable chow Mein.This dish
is not only vegetarian but also vegan. Often in Indian Chinese dishes, MSG
(mono sodium glutamate ) is also added to enhance the flavor of food which I
do not use in my cooking. Try this vegetable Chowmein recipe and do share your
comments..
