# Veg Chow Mein Recipe

**Veg Chow Mein Recipe -** This is the popular Indian-Chinese noodles stir fry
dish. This is loaded with vegetables and flavored with different sauces.

In this vegetable chow mein noodles recipe, I have added cabbage, carrot,
mushroom and capsicum. You can add finely chopped green beans, cauliflower,
baby corn etc.

We are chopping the vegetables finely unlike other indo-chinese dishes. If you
have patience and practice, do it by hand using knife. Or **you can use food
processor which will make your job much easier.**

**According to your taste, all the sauces (soy sauce, chilli sauce, ketchup)
and vinegar are adjustable.** The addition of ketchup gives nice sweet, tangy
taste.

## How to make Veg Chow Mein?

1) First boil the noodles. You can check this detailed post on how to boil the
perfect non sticky noodles. In short, Bring 4-5 cups of water to a rolling
bowl. Add big pinch of salt and noodles. Let it cook for 4-5 minutes or as per
the package instruction. Noodles should be soft, not mushy.

2) Drain the water. Run under running cold water and then add little oil and
toss the noodles. Keep it aside.

3) Heat the oil in a pan on medium heat. Once hot add chopped ginger, garlic
and celery.

4) Stir and saute for 30-40 seconds. DO NOT brown the garlic.

5) Now add sliced onions and mix.

6) Cook till onions get soft and translucent.

7) Then add all the veggies (carrot, capsicum, cabbage, mushroom).

8) Mix well and continue cooking.

9) Cook for 2-3 minutes only. Veggies are just soft, do not overcook them.

10) Now add soy sauce.

11) Add ketchup

12) Also add chilli sauce.

13) And add vinegar.

14) Mix well and let the sauce get heated through. At this time add salt and
pepper to taste.

15) Add boiled noodles and spring onion greens.

16) Toss everything together till noodles is coated with sauce mixture well.
Once noodles get heated through, turn off the stove.

Remove it to a serving plate and garnish with more spring onion greens.

_**Serving suggestion:** _Because of the addition of various sauces, this veg
chow mein noodles tastes good on its own and does not require any side dish.
But this can be served with any indo chinese gravy e.g. Gobi manchurian gravy,
veg manchurian or mushroom manchurian.

Hi  
Does your chowmein have a smoky flavor?  
I've bought some and liked it. I want to try making some.

No you don't get smoky flavor like the street stalls have. Their cooking setup
is completely different than home-based.

Absolutely delicious, loved it. Lots of preparation involved but well worth
that effort .I was looking for a chow mein recipe as I'd had it the other
night in a restaurant in Goa, it was way too hot nothing like it should be.
This recipe will be a regular for me when I return to uk. Thank you Kanan.

Hi Kanan  
When you say Haka style noodles, would it be the same as spaggetti pasta and
is the noodles eggless?

I have used Ching's hakka noodles. These are eggless and made from durum
wheat.  
While spaghetti paste is made from semolina and durum wheat.  
Having said that, you can use spaghetti pasta in place of noodles. The texture
and taste will be slightly different, but still good.
