The vegetables should be steamed,not boiled,for color,texture and nutritional
purposes. The sauce does not NEED milk(too mucous forming) water wiil do.Old
white cheddar and a teaspoon of dry hot mustard (a pinch of nutmeg too) is
even better.Pouring the sauce OVER the vegetables is more attractive for
serving.Whole wheat flour in the "roux" works at least as well.The lack of
milk will render the sauce less opaque.Not to worry,..the flavours make up for
it.Garlic,as usual, can add a wonderful dimension,but not recommended for
those counting calories or on a first date.Before steaming the veggies,dousing
in salted water greatly helps color retainment.Aside from the suggested
serving attractiveness of keeping the sauce and vegetables separate,...it is
helpful in the event of leftovers. EG:vegetable soup or chilled firm diced
sauce in an omelet or on a sandwich. ,Sincerely,
