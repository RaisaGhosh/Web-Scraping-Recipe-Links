Serve it hot with bread or baguette.

#### Tips:

â€¢ You can use any veggies as per you choice like mushroom, boiled potatoes,
French beans etcâ€¦  
â€¢ You can skip basil and cheese. Itâ€™s optional.  
â€¢ You can use dried oregano and basil instead of Italian seasoning.  
â€¢ If your pasta sauce is thick, you can add little hot water or milk to adjust
the thickness.  
â€¢ You can use black pepper as per your taste.  
â€¢ If you are living in India and you donâ€™t have dry basil and oregano, then
you can add a bit of fresh coriander or mint leaves.
