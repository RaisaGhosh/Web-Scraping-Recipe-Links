  * On a medium pan heat butter until it melts.   

  * Saute garlic until golden brown, add onions (until clear or translucent).  

  * Add the shrimp, 2 tsp salt and a pinch of pepper keep sauteing until the shrimp is cooked.   

  * Remove shrimp from pan leaving a little bit of onions and garlic. Set it aside.  

  * Pour the veggie mix on the pan. Add 1/2 cup of the water and let it simmer for 3-5 minutes (do this because some of the ready mixed veggies are bought frozen).  

  * When it starts boiling, add water chestnuts (drained), young corn (drained), and the table cream then stir.  

  * Depending on how tender u want the vegetables add the remaining 1/2 cup of water and let it boil.  

  * You can add the shrimp and quail eggs and wait for the sauce to boil and thicken a little bit or you could just top it at the end!  

  * Serve and enjoy!

  
** note: the saltiness and sweetness will vary on how thick you want the sauce
