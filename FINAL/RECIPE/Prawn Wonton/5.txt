#  Pork and prawn wontons in chilli oil sauce

Helen Graves served up a comforting pork and prawn wonton recipe, bathed in a
rich, spicy chilli oil sauce. Many people find shaping wontons a little
intimidating at first, but do not be deterred – this particular shape is super
easy to make with a little practice.

This is an incredibly satisfying dish for such a small amount of effort, and
its ability to hit the comfort food spot is unbeatable. It’s a case of mixing
together the filling ingredients, shaping the wontons and once cooked, letting
them bathe in the sauce.

They’re filled with minced pork, prawn and mushrooms and the sauce is the
rich, slippery kind that is hot, salty, tangy and just a little bit sweet;
it’s hard to resist drinking it from the bowl, to be honest.

##  Method

print recipe

1

To make the sauce, mix all the ingredients together, except for the spring
onions. Set aside

2

Make the wonton filling by mixing all the ingredients together in a mixing
bowl

3

To fold the wontons, lay one wrapper flat in your left hand (if you are right
handed), then add 1 teaspoon of the filling in the centre. Moisten your finger
with a little water, then moisten the edges of the wrapper and fold in half to
form a triangle. Make sure they are sealed well

4

Bring the two corners together into the centre to form a ‘water caltrop’
shape. Set them aside on a floured plate as you're making them

5

Cook the wontons in gently boiling water in batches of no more than 5–6, for 4
minutes. Serve in the sauce, garnished with the spring onion
