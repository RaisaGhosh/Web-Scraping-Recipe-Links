# Singapore Mei Fun (Singapore Rice Noodles, ÊòüÊ¥≤Á±≥Á≤â)

  *   *   *   * 

Jump to Recipe

_If you‚Äôre a fan of Chinese fried noodles, you must try today‚Äôs recipe for
Singapore Mei Fun, a hearty all-in-one dish full of goodness and great
flavours. Many cooking tips and substitute ideas are provided throughout the
post._

## What is Singapore Mei Fun

I had been eating Singapore Mei Fun (Singapore Rice Noodles, ÊòüÊ¥≤Á±≥Á≤â) for years
before I realised it had no confirmed association with Singapore. Some believe
it‚Äôs a creation by Hong Kong chefs based on Cantonese style fried noodles with
influence from Southeast-asian cuisine. You can find it in Cantonese eateries
and Hong Kong style tea restaurants (Ëå∂È§êÂéÖ). Also, it‚Äôs a favourite on menus of
Chinese takeaways (take-out) in the West.

Essentially, Singapore Mei Fun consists of rice vermicelli seasoned with curry
powder, soy sauce and stir-fried with egg, shrimp, Chinese BBQ pork & a
variety of crunchy vegetables. Combining many elements in one dish, it‚Äôs a
hearty, appetizing meal bursting with flavours. My recipe is for making 2
adult portions but please feel free to double it up if you have a large wok to
fry with.

## What you need for Singapore Mei Fun

As a tasty, complex all-in-one dish, Singapore Mei Fun calls for quite a few
ingredients. But don‚Äôt be intimidated by the length of the list. The end
result is so rewarding! I‚Äôm sure you will want to make it again and again. To
give you a clear idea of the composition of the dish, I classify the
ingredients into four groups:

  * **Noodles**. More precisely, you will need dried rice vermicelli which is known as Mei Fun (or Mai Fun).
  *  **Proteins**. The traditional recipes use eggs, fresh shrimp and Char Siu (Chinese BBQ pork). I will write about substitute ideas in later sections.
  *  **Vegetables**. You would need a number of crunchy vegetables for adding another layer of texture. It would be even better if they provide different colours for an appetizing look.
  *  **Seasonings**. The must-have is yellow curry powder which gives the dish its iconic bright yellow colour. Other seasonings include soy sauce, oyster sauce, etc.

##

## The summary of cooking steps

Before I start explaining the tips on each cooking step, here is an outline of
what to expect during the process.

  1. Prepare vermicelli until it‚Äôs softened but not yet fully cooked.
  2. Mix liquid seasonings and salt before you start cooking.
  3. Fry eggs and shrimp in oil then set aside.
  4. Release the aroma of curry powder and garlic in a little oil.
  5. Combine all the elements of the dish in a certain sequence to finish the dish.

##

## How to choose and prepare Mei Fun

The main star of today‚Äôs dish Mei Fun/Á±≥Á≤â (sometimes spelt Mai Fun) is a type
of very thin, dried rice noodles also known as vermicelli or rice vermicelli.
Be careful not to confuse Mei Fun with Fen Si/Á≤â‰∏ù which looks very similar but
is made of mung bean starch and become much more transparent after cooking
than Mei Fun (see examples in Spicy Vermicelli Stir-fry and Whiter Melon &
Meatball Soup). When purchasing, check out the ingredient list if uncertain.

You might find Mei Fun of various brands made in different Asian countries.
Generally speaking, you can use any of them for this dish. However, they might
require different methods to prepare. Follow the instructions on the package
to pre-cook/soak it before you start stir-frying.

I often use a Taiwanese brand of Mei Fun which advises boiling the noodles for
1 min. For me, a better alternative is to soak them in very hot water for 2
mins (because I find it less hassle to boil water in a kettle than to cook the
noodles in a pot). At this stage, your Mei Fun should be pliable and springy,
but not fully cooked. Otherwise, they will become mushy during the next step,
stir-frying.

No matter how you prepare them, remember to cut the pre-cooked/soaked noodles
into shorter sections with scissors. This will make stir-frying and serving a
little easier.

## Fry protein ingredients & substitute ideas

Usually, you would find one single protein ingredient in Chinese-style noodle
dishes. Singapore Mei Fun, however, typically requires three! The most common
choices are egg, shrimp and Char Siu (Chinese BBQ pork). It‚Äôs kind of luxury
for a simple noodle dish. I think this is one of the reasons why it‚Äôs so
popular!

**Egg.**  This is the first thing you need to cook. Use the same method I
introduced in Tomato & Egg Stir-fry and Egg Fried Rice Noodles. Heat up the
oil over high heat until it smokes. Pour in the lightly beaten egg. When it
turns solid, break into small pieces with a spatula. Dish out and set aside.

**Shrimp.** After you scoop out the egg, use the same wok (there should be a
thin layer of oil left) to briefly seal the shrimp. Once they turn pink and
curl up, transfer out straightaway. To retain their tenderness, do not
overcook .

**Char Siu.** Since it‚Äôs already cooked, add Char Siu later along with
vegetables. Have you ever tried making Char Siu yourself? If not, check out my
post on Easy Char Siu which shows you how to cook it to a perfect texture with
ease.

üõé **CAN I USE SUBSTITUES?**  Yes, you surely can! Replace one or two of the
above ingredients with shredded chicken, sliced Chinese sausage, beef strips
(learn how to prepare it in my recipe for Beef Chow Fun), etc.

üõé **CAN I SKIP EGG AND/OR MEAT?**  You can do that too. To make this dish
vegetarian/vegan friendly, I suggest you use five-spice tofu or smoked tofu as
protein. It will taste very nice too!

## Use yellow curry powder to coat the noodles

Another feature that makes Singapore Mei Fun stand out is its bright yellow
colour. This appetizing look comes from yellow curry powder which contains
turmeric (a spice known as poor man's saffron). Please feel free to use any
type of yellow-coloured curry powder that‚Äôs available to you. Alternatively,
use brown-looking curry powder and add extra turmeric for the colour.

After you‚Äôve cooked the egg and shrimp, add more cooking oil to the wok. Fry
curry powder and some minced garlic over low heat to slowly release their
aroma. Pay attention not to burn them though. When you see bubbles becoming
intense, it‚Äôs time to add Mei Fun.

To efficiently coat the Mei Fun with the curry, I recommend you keep the heat
low and use a pair of chopsticks to stir, flip and loosen the noodles. Once
they turn yellow evenly, turn the heat up to medium high and move on to the
next step.

## Add crunchy vegetables for nutrition & taste

I choose three crunchy vegetables, mung bean sprouts, red onion and bell
pepper, to go into this noodle dish. They also provide wonderful colours to
make it even more appealing on the eyes. Add them to the wok along with Char
Siu. Use chopsticks and spatular together to stir constantly. Once they‚Äôre
evenly heated, you can put in the egg and shrimp.

If you happen to have other vegetables at hand, don‚Äôt hesitate to substitute.
carrot, napa cabbage, courgette, Chinese chive, stem lettuce, etc. Just mix
and match whatever you fancy!

## Finished the dish with a tasty sauce

Now, it‚Äôs time to pour in the sauce and sprinkle some finely chopped scallions
to finish. As I always emphasise when writing recipes for fast stir-fry
dishes, remember to have the sauce mixed before you begin to cook. You‚Äôll need
soy sauce, oyster sauce, Shaoxing rice wine (optional), sesame oil, lime
juice, salt and a little sugar. Give everything a quick final stir then dish
out to serve.

### Instructions

#### Prepare the vermicelli

  * You can either follow the instructions on the package to prepare the rice vermicelli or use my method: Put them into a large bowl. Pour in hot water (just boiled) enough to cover. Leave to soak for 2 mins.

  * Drain well then cut into shorter sections with a pair of scissors. Set aside (see note 1).

#### Mix the sauce

  * In a small bowl, mix light soy sauce, oyster sauce, Shaoxing rice wine, seame oil, salt, sugar, lime juice and water. Set aside.

#### Fry the eggs & shrimp

  * Heat up half of the cooking oil in a wok until it smokes. Pour in the egg. Fry until cooked then break it into small pieces with a spatula. Transfer to a plate.

  * In the same wok, sear the shrimp (no need to pour in more oil). As soon as they curl up and turn pink, transfer to the egg plate.

#### Stir-fry to finish

  * Pour the other half of the cooking oil into the wok. Fry garlic and yellow curry powder over low heat for 20 seconds or so (Do not burn).

  * Stir in the vermicelli. With the aid of a pair of chopsticks, loosen the vermicelli to have it evenly coated by the curry.

  * Turn the heat to medium high. Add Char Siu, mung bean sprouts, bell pepper & red onion. Constantly stir (I use chopsticks and a spatula at the same time) to evenly heat all the ingredients until the vegetables are cooked but still retain some of the crunchiness.

  * Put the egg and shrimp back into the wok. Add the sauce and scallions. Give everything a quick stir then serve immediately.

### NOTES

1\. Mei Fun is very thin, dried noodles made of rice (the main ingredient). Be
careful not to confuse it with Fen Si/Á≤â‰∏ù which looks very similar but is made
of mung bean starch. When purchasing, check out the ingredient list if
uncertain.

2\. You can either use shop-bought Char Siu or make it at home following my
Easy Char Siu recipe. Alternatively, substitute with shredded chicken, sliced
Chinese sausage, beef strips (learn how to prepare it in my recipe for Beef
Chow Fun), etc.

3\. Any type of yellow-coloured curry powder would work. Alternatively, use
brown-looking curry powder and add extra turmeric for the colour.

I came across your recipe while looking for a new dish to use the mung beans I
had just sprouted. The dish turned out excellent. While prepping I realized I
was out of shrimp in the freezer so I fried up some Chinese sausage instead.
It turned out perfect. Thank you for the wonderful recipe. I have already
printed it & added it to my recipe index. I am looking forward to trying some
of your other dishes.

Outstanding! Thank you, also, for fixing my mei fun noodles! So simple. Your
recipe has such a delicate balance of flavors. Instant hit here! I'd probably
double up on the curry but that's living in Texas.

Now I'm moving on to your Hot and Sour Soup.

Thank you ma'am!

We used to have this dish every time we went to Penang to have our Thai visa
renewed. I did not know what it was called and could not find a recipe that
looked even remotely similar. Thank you SO much for posting this recipe!
Everyone in the family will be so excited when I cook this. They will also be
happy because I will FINALLY make char siu again‚Ä¶

What a find! Your website is terrific. I've already made the dumpling wrapper
recipe and I will never buy the store-bought ones again! And the Singapore
noodles are just like I remember them from Hong Kong. I plan to cook my way
through many of these recipes, for sure.  
Oh, and thanks for warning readers not to substitute balsamic vinegar for
Chekiang vinegar-I have seen too many recipes suggesting that substitution,
and the flavor is completely different.
