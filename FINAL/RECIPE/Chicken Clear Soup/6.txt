#### How to make Chicken Clear Soup

  1. To a bowl, add corn flour, water to make a thick paste. Set it aside.
  2. Wash chicken thoroughly. You can add 2 tablespoons of vinegar to get rid of its rawness. Chop it into small cubes.
  3. Add chicken cubes to a pressure cooker along with salt and black pepper.
  4. Add onion, garlic, ginger, bay leaf, chili, carrot, thyme, water and pressure cook until a whistle.
  5. Simmer and cook for another 10 minutes.
  6. Turn off the heat. When the pressure subsides, drain the stock discarding the vegetables.
  7. Remove the chicken cubes and shred them into smaller pieces.
  8. Transfer clear soup to a cooking pan and add a few pieces of chicken and corn flour paste. Simmer and cook until soup thickens.
  9. Garnish with coriander leaves, cilantro leaves, spring onions, and chopped red chili.
  10. Serve hot and enjoy!

Why does chopping an onion makes your tear glands all worked up? Onions
release sulfuric acid that reacts with eyes and produces tears.
