Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times

Whenever I use a red-tinged vegetable like amaranth in a dish I know the
vegetable is bringing with it lots of antioxidant-rich anthocyanins, a
flavonoid found in dark red and blue pigments. Use beet greens if you can’t
find amaranth; they will bring with them the same red pigments, which make for
a richly colored sauce. For a beautiful meal, serve the stir-fry with red
rice, like Bhutanese rice.

### Preparation

  1. Combine the broth, 2 teaspoons of the soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon of the rice wine or sherry and sugar in a small bowl. Combine the garlic, 1 tablespoon of the ginger, and the minced chiles in another bowl. Have all of your ingredients within reach of your wok or pan.
  2. In a medium bowl combine the cornstarch, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon rice wine or sherry, and 1 tablespoon of the ginger. Stir together well. Lightly salt the shrimp and toss with the cornstarch mixture until coated.
  3. Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or a 12-inch skillet over high heat until a drop of water evaporates within a second or two when added to the pan. Add in the oil by pouring it on the sides of the pan and swirling the pan. Add the garlic, ginger and chiles and stir-fry for no more than 10 seconds. Add the red pepper and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the shrimp with any liquid in the bowl and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, until pink and opaque. Add the amaranth (or beet greens) and scallions, stir-fry for about 30 seconds, add the broth mixture and stir-fry for 1 minute, or until the greens have wilted. Add the cilantro and stir-fry for another 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and serve with rice or noodles, red rice being my first choice.

####  Tip

  * Advanced preparation: This is all last-minute, though you can prep your ingredients well in advance and refrigerate.
