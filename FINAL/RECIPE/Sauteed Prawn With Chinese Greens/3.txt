## Prawns & Vegetable Stir Fry

{{totalReview}}

Looking for a staple meal for weekday dinners? Look no further because the
prawns and vegetable stir-fry isa quick and healthy dish that will satisfy
little (and big) bellies alike. The garlic and variety of vegetables gives
this dish its fragrance, and the prawn, its subtle sweetness. Here’s a tip
–chop the broccoli small or steam it a little before frying so that it will
have the same crunch as the other vegetables. Serve with a bowl of rice for a
complete meal.
