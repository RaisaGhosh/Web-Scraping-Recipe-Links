Julia Gartland for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Monica Pierini.

Drew Spangler Faulkner, a cooking teacher at L’Academie de Cuisine in
Bethesda, Md., makes a Thai green curry that is a kind of comfort food. The
sauce, made creamy with coconut milk, and gently spicy with the curry paste,
is flavorful yet soothing. The vegetables, which are simply dropped into the
sauce, and gently simmered for about 12 minutes, turn out tender, not soggy.
It is startlingly simple. She makes her own green curry paste, but the recipe
calls for any one of three store bought pastes. Although some green curry
pastes contain fish or shrimp paste, she has found three brands which do not:
Thai Taste, Maesri and Thai Kitchen. --Elaine Louie

### Preparation

  1. Open the can of coconut milk without shaking it. Spoon 6 tablespoons of the coconut cream from the top of the can into a medium saucepan. Pour remaining contents of can into a medium bowl, and mix well. In a medium bowl, combine vegetable stock, soy sauce, and palm or brown sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
  2. Place saucepan of coconut cream over medium-high heat until it begins to bubble. Add curry paste and reduce heat to medium-low. Stir constantly until very fragrant, about 3 minutes; adjust heat as needed to prevent burning. Add onion, red pepper, zucchini, sweet potato, bamboo shoots, green beans, and eggplant. Stir until vegetables are hot, 2-3 minutes. Stir in coconut milk, bring the mixture to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.
  3. Add the soy sauce mixture and a generous squeeze of fresh lime juice to taste; you may use the juice of an entire lime. Stir and mix well. Add up to 1/4 cup water if the curry seems too thick.
  4. To serve, place the curry in a warm serving bowl and garnish with the basil chiffonade. If desired, serve over jasmine rice.
