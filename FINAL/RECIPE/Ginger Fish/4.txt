We loved this flavorful fish! I used tilapia and cooked it for only about 30
minutes and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing your recipe! Made for Spring

Love ginger with fish, and this recipe sounded so good, so I had to try it.
The ingredients work really well together, but next time I think I'll marinate
the fish in the mix that you bake the fish in. This made for a very enjoyable
dinner on a weeknight after work. Thanks for sharing! Made for ZWT7. I
modified the review to correct the apostrophe thing that happens when you copy
and paste from word. It showed up as a bunch of numbers and symbols, and I
corrected it when posting my reviews to my review cookbook.
