Ginger fish is one of those dishes that is fun to eat. The ginger gives the
fish a zesty quality that is different than lemon but still very strong. Fish
can be a relatively bland meat; it is highly influenced by how you season it.
This recipe in particular uses very few seasonings, choosing instead to focus
on the power and taste of the ginger. If the ginger taste is too intense then
don’t hesitate to make some adjustments and useless.

Packing this for lunch? Make sure you carry it in an insulated **lunch box**.
