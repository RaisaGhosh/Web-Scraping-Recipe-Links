Indo-Chinese Style Ginger Fish Recipe is a wonderful side dish that you must
try. We have kept it very simple with slight taste of Indo- Asian flavors. The
basa fish is crispy fried with corn flour batter and cooked along with a
ginger flavored gravy that goes really well with the fish. In order to add
more color and texture dish we have also added chunks for red and green bell
peppers that also adds to the taste.

Basa is a type of cat fish that is native to Vietnam and Thailand which is
found to be rich in protein. It is not as lean when compared to other fish but
when consumed at minimal quantity it will be beneficial.

## How to make Indo-Chinese Style Ginger Fish Recipe

  1. To begin making the Indo-Chinese Style Ginger Fish Recipe, we will first coat the fish pieces with corn flour, salt and pepper.

  2. Heat a kadai with enough oil to fry the fish pieces, when the oil turn hot, drop the fish pieces one by one slowly into the oil and fry them till they turn golden brown.

  3. Repeat the same for the rest of the pieces and keep them on paper towel to drain all the oil.

  4. In a bowl mix all the ingredients for the sauces with 1 cup of water to blend completely and keep it aside. Heat a wok with oil.

  5. Once it turns hot, add ginger, garlic and saute till it softens. Add sliced onions and cook them till turn translucent.

  6. Add bell peppers and saute them till they are cooked. This will take about 10 minutes and later you can add fried fish pieces into the wok.

  7. Reduce the flame and add sauce mixture and mix well till the gravy thickens. Check for salt, once that thickens switch off the heat and serve hot by sprinkle chopped spring onions and serve hot.

  8. Serve the Indo-Chinese Style Ginger Fish Recipe along with Spicy Vegetable Noodlesto make it a complete meal for your Sunday lunch.
