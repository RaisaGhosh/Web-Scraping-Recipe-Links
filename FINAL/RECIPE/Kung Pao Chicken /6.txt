# Kung Pao Sauce

Kung pao sauce is one of the popular home style stir fry sauces in Szechuan
cuisine. Making perfect kung pao sauce at home is simple but not an easy task.
This is elaine‚Äôs detailed guide about how to prepare a kung pao sauce and
apply it on your preferred vegetables and ingredients.

Kung pao sauce has two layers of flavor, one is from spices and the other one
is from a balance via soy sauce, vinegar and sugar. Firstly, we fry garlic,
ginger and scallion with dried red pepper. This taste is called as ‚ÄúËÉ°Ëæ£Âë≥‚ÄùÔºåwhich
means fried chili pepper taste. To get this unique taste, the dried chili
pepper should be fried until dark red. Some restaurants add un-fried red chili
pepper to add some red color but they cannot bring the right flavor.

The second layer is a balanced sauce made from sugar, vinegar and soy sauce
with starch. Starch works as a thickener and help the sauce sticking to the
ingredient.

### Important ingredients introductions

**Leek onion (Â§ßËë±)** is a popular aromatic ingredient for lots of Chinese stir
fries and soups. Comparing with green onion, leek onion provides a stronger
flavor. We usually use the white part and discard the very green part and then
cut them into sections around 1.5 cm in thickness. I love to keep half of the
leek onion sections to the last step and fry them with chili pepper and
Szechuan peppercorn.

**Szechuan pepper and dried chili pepper :** Szechuan peppercorn (Ëä±Ê§í) and
dried red chili pepper are the two soul ingredients for this dish. It should
be a slightly numbing with a gentle touch of hotness. **** We have three types
of dried red pepper used in Sichuan cuisine, but the most popular choice for
Kung pao chicken is that small and thin pepper.

_The mischievous factor of this sauce is the amount of sugar. I usually add
more sugar with protein dishes but use only use half of the sugar in vegetable
kong pao dishes like cauliflower, lotus root and mushrooms. Because vegetables
and mushrooms have nature sweetness. _

Hi Anita,  
Whole Sichuan peppercorn plays totally differently from grounded peppercorn
powder. We use whole Sichuan peppercorn mostly for its aroma while pepper for
the numbing feeling, just like what we did in mapo tofu.
