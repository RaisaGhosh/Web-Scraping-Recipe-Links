Hakka noodles, the name comes from the hakka people – the chinese tribe that
first moved to calcutta in the late 1700s. These noodles are processed and
thus don’t take much time to cook. The boiled noodles and veggies are made
much in advance and kept ready for the hungry diners. You just need to wait a
few minutes for the noodles to be tossed!

Handy tip:

  1. To make 4 cups of boiled noodles: boil enough water in a deep pan, add salt, 1 tbsp of oil and 2 packets of noodles and cook till the noodles is 85% cooked. Drain using a strainer or colander and refresh using cold water.
  2. Let all the water drain out and ensure that the noodles do not contain any moisture. Spread evenly on a thali and keep aside to cool completely. Use as required.
  3. However, the quantity of cooked noodles will vary with the brand used. We have used the regular local brand, which vendors commonly use.
