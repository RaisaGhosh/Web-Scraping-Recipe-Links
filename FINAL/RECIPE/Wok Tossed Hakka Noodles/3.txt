# Wok Tossed Hakka Noodles with Chicken and Lap Cheong - Chef Recipe by Luke
Nguyen

 __Serves: 4

* * *

## Ingredients

"While checking out Block M, a bar district in Jakarta, I asked the younger
locals where they went for street food. I was surprised when they directed me
to the very centre of Block M where there's a newish food precinct called Food
Fighters. This place is a slice of modern Jakarta so it's interesting to see,
on that level alone. You can get everything here from lattes to Mexican food,
to charcoal bun burgers to waffles, but I was recommended the noodles at Mie
Chino. A young guy runs this place and he has just four dishes on his menu. Of
these I thought the stir-fried Hakka noodles with chicken and lap cheong were
pretty special. They're also easy to make and I can't recommend enough that
you add them to your ‘I need to cook dinner in a great hurry' repertoire. They
only require simple ingredients and literally 3 minutes of cooking time, and
you're there. Too easy." ~ Luke Nguyen.  
  
400 g (14 oz) fresh yellow Hakka egg noodles  
2 Tbs peanut oil  
2 garlic cloves, finely diced  
150 g (5 1/2 oz) boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into small pieces  
50 g (1 3/4 oz) lap cheong (Chinese dried sausage; see glossary), sliced  
150 g (5 1/2 oz) choy sum (Chinese flowering cabbage), cut into 4 cm (1 1/2
in) lengths  
150 g (5 1/2 oz) bean sprouts  
1 Tbs sambal oelek chilli paste  
2 Tbs kecap manis  
Pinch of sea salt  
1 Tbs Fried Red Asian Shallots (see page 152), to garnish  
2 spring onions (scallions), sliced, to garnish

## Method

Bring a saucepan of water to the boil. Blanch the noodles in the water for 20
seconds, then remove and drain. Set aside.  
  
Heat the peanut oil in a wok over a high heat. Add the garlic and saute until
fragrant, then add the chicken and lap cheong. Stir-fry for 2 minutes.  
  
Add the blanched noodles, choy sum and bean sprouts and stir-fry for a further
minute, then add the sambal oelek, kecap manis and a pinch of salt. Stir-fry
for another minute.  
  
Transfer to individual plates, garnish with fried shallots and spring onions
and serve.
