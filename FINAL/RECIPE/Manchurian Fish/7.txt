# Chilli Fish Recipe - Indian Chinese Chilli Fish Recipe

November 24, 2015 9 Comments

**Chilli Fish** is one of amma's specialty Indo-Chinese Recipes. Like I
mentioned in the **fried rice recipe** post, amma is an expert in making
manchurian and related recipes. There's really no secret sauce (literally!) to
her recipes, they just work excellently and this Chilli Fish is no exception.
Maybe those of you who are off lent tomorrow can try **Chilli Fish for Easter
lunch**?

We also make the same dish with Prawns and call it **Chinese Fried Prawns**.
That's a dish from my childhood that I have fond memories of. You can serve
the batter-fried prawns with ketchup as a starter or go on to make Chilli
Prawns with it following the recipe below.

Although Indo-Chinese sauces are easily available in Singapore, I find that
the Indian brands like Sil or **Ching 's Secret** (I am guessing that's an
Indian brand) seem to work better for me and taste more "authentic" like you
get in Indo-Chinese restaurants in India.

I have had a few failures when making manchurian and chilli something but
after this **Gobi Manchurian recipe** , flops are history. I learnt from the
best (my sister makes amazing manchurian too) after all!

Interested in a **Chilli Chicken Recipe **or **Chilli Prawns **instead?

##  INDIAN CHINESE CHILLI FISH RECIPE

_Preparation time: 15 minutes_  
_Cooking time: 30 minutes_  
_Serves 4_  
_Recipe source: Amma_

**Ingredients:**

  * 250 gm of cut into small cubes, deboned fish (any fish with a firm flesh would do)
  * 3 tbsp + 1 tsp of cornflour / corn starch
  * 3 tbsp of maida / plain flour
  * 1 tsp + 1 tsp of ginger garlic paste
  * 1 tsp of black pepper powder
  * 1 capsicum / bell pepper, cubed
  * 1 onion, cubed
  * 1/2 to 1 tbsp of soya sauce
  * 1 tsp of green chilli sauce
  * 1 tsp of tomato sauce
  * A small bunch of spring onions or coriander leaves, chopped fine

**How to Make Chilli Fish**

  1. Make a thick batter of 3 tbsp cornflour + flour + 1 tsp ginger garlic paste + salt + pepper powder + water
  2. Dip the fish pieces in this and shallow fry in oil until golden brown (in small batches without crowding the pan)
  3. Drain and set aside
  4. In the same oil, add the onions and capsicum. When the onions start to turn pink, add the ginger garlic paste and saute until fragrant
  5. Turn heat to high and add the soya sauce, chilli sauce and tomato sauce (keep them ready by your side to prevent the rest of the dish burning)
  6. Mix well and reduce heat. Add the fried fish pieces
  7. Mix well and cook on low heat. Meanwhile, mix the 1 tsp cornflour in 4 tbsp water without lumps. Add to the fish mixture and cook until the sauce thickens and coats the fish
  8. Add chopped coriander leaves or spring onions and remove from stove
  9. Serve chilli fish hot with fried rice

First time making chilli fish and this was such a great find! I air fried the
fish pieces so i didn't get a brown colour but it was super crispy and tasty!
Other variations: i added 1 teaspoon rice flour to the batter, tomato paste
instead of tomato sauce, a splash of vinegar and this was super awesome!

every single time I make it, it sells out.
