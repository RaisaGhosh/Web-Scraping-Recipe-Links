Fish Manchurian Recipe is a tasty and super delicious dish. It is easy to
prepare and takes just about 30 minutes to make it.

## Ingredients:

  * Oil for shallow frying or deep frying
  * 250 gms fish fillet
  * 1 ½ tbsps. Corn flour
  * 1 ½ tbsps. Plain flour
  * **Sauce ingredients**
  * 3 garlic cloves minced
  * 2 tbsps. Green parts of Spring onions
  * 2 tbsps. White part of spring onion
  * ¼ each of green and red bell pepper cubed
  * ¾ tsp. corn flour (optional)
  * 1 tsp. soya sauce (you can reduce little)
  * 1 tsp. vinegar
  * 2 tsp. red chili sauce
  * ½ tsp. sugar (optional, you can skip if you do not like sweet taste, but that’s how the Manchurian dishes taste)
  * **Marination ingredients**
  * Salt very title
  * ¾ tsp. Soya sauce
  * ⅛ tsp. Pepper powder
  * 1.5 tsps ginger garlic paste (optional, I did not use)

## Method: Fish Manchurian Recipe

  * Wash the fish and cut into cube sized pieces
  * Add Soya sauce, ginger garlic paste, and pepper powder. Mix and marinate. Set aside for at least 30 mins.
  * Add the sauces to a bowl and set aside.
  * Heat a pan with oil for deep or shallow frying or preheat the oven and bake.
  * Add 1 ½ tbsps. each of Corn flour and Plain flour, little salt and stir well. Sprinkle some water and mix to coat the fish with flour. The batter should not be runny. Fish has to be coated with a thin layer of batter
  * Fry the fish pieces to golden on a medium flame. Drain these on an absorbent tissue.
  * After you finish frying fish, drain the oil from the pan retaining 2 tbsps. oil in the same pan
  * Add garlic and fry till it gets fragrant. Add capsicum, layered onions (white parts of spring onions) and fry on high flame for about 3 mins. Onions and capsicums should be crunchy (not overcooked) and not soft.
  * Stir the sauce mix. When it bubbles, add fish. To make a gravy version, pour the cornflour mixture first. Allow it to thicken on a low flame, it gets done quickly. Then add the fish.
  * Switch off the heat and stir well. For dry recipe, fry on high for 2 to 3 minutes
  * Garnish with chopped spring onions
