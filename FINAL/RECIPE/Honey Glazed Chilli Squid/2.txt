## Directions

  1. Place fish sauce, honey, garlic and chilli in a bowl and whisk to combine.
  2. Score squid with the tip of a sharp knife making a tight-knit criss-cross pattern on the inner side of each piece.
  3. Place in a non-metallic dish, pour marinade over squid, cover and refrigerate for 30-60 minutes.
  4. Heat a wok or frying pan over a medium-high heat and stir-fry squid in several batches for 2-4 minutes.
  5. The honey will cause the squid to caramelise and can catch and burn, so keep it moving.
  6. Serve with extra soy sauce on the side.
