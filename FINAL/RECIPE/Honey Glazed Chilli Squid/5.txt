# Honey Soy Squid, Cashew Nuts and Sichuan Pepper

Josh Emett

### Ingredients

  * Rice bran oil
  * 1/4 red onion, sliced
  * 2 dried chillies, whole
  * 1/4 cup cashew nuts, toasted
  * 3 squid tubes, cleaned, scored on the inside, cut into triangles
  * 1/4 cup rice flour

  

**Honey Soy Sauce**

  * 50g thick soy sauce
  * 100g honey

**To Serve**

  * Pinch sichuan pepper
  * Fresh coriander

### Method

Heat a fryer to 180°C and put a wok on a gas hob. Add rice bran oil to the wok
then gently sauté the onion. Add the whole chillies and cashews.

Meanwhile, toss the squid in rice flour then cook in the fryer until crispy,
approx. 45 seconds. Lift to drain.

Combine soy sauce and honey in a squeezy bottle. Squeeze approx. 3 tablespoons
of the honey soy sauce into the wok and turn up the heat. Toss fried squid
through and reduce until squid is well coated and glazed. Add the sichuan
pepper, then plate and garnish with coriander.

_**Wine match, 2015 Equinox, Waipara Valley Pinot Gris**_

_A rich and textural Pinot Gris that opens up wonderfully with time in the
glass. The heat of the Sichuan pepper with the richness of cashew, honey and
soy will match beautifully with the textured flavours of the Equinox Pinot
Gris._
