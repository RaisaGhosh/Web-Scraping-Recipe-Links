**Hong Kong Style Steamed Fish**

We love our steamed fishes over at the Yeo family, and the Hong Kong style of
steaming fish is by far our favourite steaming technique. The sauce is what
makes it so special, so here's a recipe for steamed Sea Bass or Wrasse/ Parrot
fish.

For the Fish

  * 800g-1kg Sea Bass or Wrasse/ Parrot fish (青衣), gutted, butterflied, fins and tail trimmed
  * ½ thumb young ginger, julienned into thin strips
  * 1 stalks spring onions, chopped 
  * 2 tspn white pepper powder
  * 1 tbspn Shaoxing wine

For the sauce

  * 2 tbspn superior light soy sauce
  * 1 tbspn superior dark soy sauce 
  * 1 tbspn Shaoxing wine
  * 1 tbspn sesame oil
  * 1 tspn white pepper powder
  * Half a thumb-sized rock sugar 
  * 3-4 tbspn water

For the garnish

  * 1 thumb-sized ginger, julienned into thin strips
  * 1-2 garlic cloves, chopped finely
  * 1 bunch coriander leaves, torn up loosely
  * 1 spring onion, chopped 
  * 1 tspn sesame oil

  1. Prepare the fish by patting it dry with a kitchen towel. Using a large porcelain plate, lay the base layer with the chopped spring onion, and the julienned ginger. Rub the insides of the fish with white pepper and the Shaoxing wine, and lay the fish on the plate.
  2. In the meantime, prepare the sauce. Pour the sauce ingredients into a sauce pan and bring it up to a low simmer. Once the rock sugar has melted, take it off the heat and set aside.
  3. Prepare the garnish. In a skillet, fry the garlic and ginger in the sesame oil over a medium flame until they are crisp and golden brown. Set aside.
  4. Steam the fish. The rule of thumb for me is that any fish that's 800-1.2kg, I'd steam for exactly 11 minutes. Fish bigger than 1.2kg, I'd add another 3 minutes of steaming time. The trick is to steam until the bits of flesh around the bone still sticks to the bone. And if you can't fit the whole fish in your steaming pan, don't steam it! Salt bake it (I'll provide the recipe later on).
  5. Once done, take out the fish, laddle in the sauce and the garnish and serve steaming hot.
