HK Style Fish Fillet in Cream Sauce Pasta. Crispy breaded fish cutlet fried
and paired over a bed of garlic cream sauce pasta. A popular East meets West
dish that is often served at Hong Kong style cafes. Great for dinner or lunch.

This dish is one of my husband‚Äôs all time favourite dishes to eat at Hong Kong
style cafes, also known as ‚ÄúCha-Chaan Tang‚Äù. Hong Kong Style cafes are known
to serve a mix of popular Asian foods along with Western food like French
toast, Baked Porkchops on rice, egg, and ham sandwiches and more!

My version of this Cantonese fish cutlet in cream sauce pasta is easy to make
at home and prepared using an air fryer. **However, if you don‚Äôt own an air
fryer, I will share deep frying instructions and ingredients in the Notes
section below of the recipe card.**

Now there are many fish fillet in cream sauce recipes online, but I never saw
one that was Hong Kong style surprisingly. So, I thought why not share this
dish that many know and love. There are also other variations of this same
dish using rice or using tomato sauce instead of cream. However, I really
wanted to share the version my husband and I enjoy which is fish fillet in
creamy white sauce and pasta!

## What does this taste like?

Imagine taking a bite of crispy fried white fish that is seasoned and breaded
in breadcrumbs. Then paired with a bite of ultra creamy white sauce spaghetti
with a garlicky flavour. It‚Äôs so good you‚Äôll be wanting more.

## Easy to make!

This fish fillet in white sauce and pasta is easy to make at home! And if
you‚Äôre good at multitasking, it should only take 30 minutes to prepare a large
batch to feed 4 or more!

First cut the fillets into equal sized pieces, pat dry and coat them in flour,
egg, and breadcrumbs. Then transfer the filets to the air fryer basket.
Spraying a bit of oil over top and air fry at 400 degrees F for 6 minutes on
each side. If you don‚Äôt have an air fryer, you would deep fry the filets until
golden crispy brown, 6-8 minutes in total, over medium heat in 2 cups of
vegetable oil.

While the fish is frying, in a large pot filled halfway with water bring to
boil and boil the pasta for 10 minutes or until Al Dente texture. Then strain
it. Add the strained pasta back into your large pot.

Then in a large saucepan set over medium heat, melt the butter. Once it‚Äôs
melted, add flour, and mix to create a roux. To the roux, add minced garlic,
salt, milk, and chicken stock. Whisk everything together and let this simmer
and bubble until it‚Äôs thickened. Pour the thick sauce over the pasta and mix
well.

Plate your pasta and place fish cutlets over top to serve. Optional garnish:
dried parsley leaves.

## HK Style Fish Fillet Pasta Bake

Now if you want, you can also bake the cream sauce pasta first for 5 minutes
at 500 degrees F and then remove and place the fish cutlets over top. This is
one way the HK style cafes will serve this dish but to be honest, there wasn‚Äôt
much of a taste difference to me, and it also required more time and work.

## Tips

Below are tips on making the best fish cutlet with cream sauce pasta recipe:

  * Use quality white sturdy fish like cod, haddock or pollock.
  * Feel free to use frozen or fresh fish. Either one will work well.
  * Be sure to thaw your frozen fish if you‚Äôre using that and let the water drain or pat the fish dry before seasoning.
  * Season the fish generously with salt and garlic powder on both sides. This is important or you‚Äôll have tasteless fish.
  * Cut the fish fillets into equal sizes so they fry evenly.
  * Coat the fish into the flour, egg, and breadcrumbs GENEROUSLY. This is important or you‚Äôll have patchy fillets.
  * Leave enough space around each fillet when you air fry. If you‚Äôre deep frying, do not overcrowd the oil, only fry a few pieces at a time or it‚Äôll lead to soggy fish.
  * Salt your pasta water. This makes a difference for tastier pasta.
  * Using a non-stick pan for the cream sauce is very helpful!
  * When creating your cream sauce, prepare your ingredients ahead of time so you can create a proper roux.
  * When making the cream sauce, cook over low-medium heat and do not increase heat past that.

## For this recipe

You will need the following ingredients for my Hong Kong cream sauce fish with
pasta:

  * 454 grams spaghetti, uncooked & dried
  * 1 tbsp salt, for pasta water
  * 500 grams white fish filets (5 large pieces)
  * 1 ¬º cup panko breadcrumbs
  * 2 eggs, beaten
  * ¬Ω cup all-purpose flour
  * ¬Ω tsp salt
  * 1 tsp garlic powder

Cream sauce:

  * 2 cups whole milk
  * ¬Ω cup chicken stock, unsalted
  * 2 tbsp butter, unsalted
  * 2 tsp garlic, minced
  * ¬º cup all purpose flour
  * 1 tsp salt

## How to make fish cutlet with cream sauce pasta

  1. Slice your filets into 5-inch-long pieces. Pat dry with a paper towel. Season with salt and garlic powder.
  2. Prepare three separate bowls and add all-purpose flour to one and panko breadcrumbs to another. In the last bowl, beat two eggs. Dredge each fillet in all-purpose flour first, then eggs, and lastly panko.
  3. Transfer coated filets to air fryer basket (you may need to divide into two batches depending on the size of your air fryer). Make sure there‚Äôs enough space around each filet. Spray 1 tsp of oil over top. Air fry at 400 degrees F for 12 minutes in total - flipping over halfway spraying oil on the other side as well. For deep frying instructions, please refer to NOTES sections below.
  4. Meanwhile, fill a large pot with water halfway and season with 1 tbsp of salt. Bring to boil and add your pasta. Boil for 10 minutes or until Al-Dente texture. Strain immediately. Then place pasta back into large pot and set aside to keep warm.
  5. In a large saucepan set over medium heat, melt the butter. Once melted, add flour, and mix well until incorporated. Add minced garlic, salt, milk, and chicken stock. Whisk constantly until the sauce bubbles and thickens, about 5-7 minutes.
  6. Once sauce has thickened (you‚Äôll know when you glide a spatula through the sauce and you can see the base of your pan), pour cream sauce into pot with pasta. Mix pasta with sauce.
  7. Plate your pasta and add cooked fish fillets over top. Optional garnish, sprinkle dried parsley flakes over top. Enjoy!

## Notes:

To deep fry the fish, fill a pot or wok with 2 cups of vegetable oil and bring
to medium heat. To test if oil is hot enough, place a wooden chopstick and
look for bubbles to form at the end. Carefully add coated fish filet into hot
oil, half a batch at a time. Fry until golden brown, 6-8 minutes in total,
flipping over halfway. Transfer fried fish to cooling rack to allow excess oil
to drip.
