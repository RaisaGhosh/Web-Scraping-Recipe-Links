**The flesh of fresh cod is silky and practically melts in your mouth. Cod has
a ‘sweet’ taste that you can just eat it on its own without seasoning, simply
umami.**  
By Shannon Lim  
  
Steamed Cod Fish is another indulging recipe you can effortlessly recreate at
home. This recipe is simple and absolutely delicious. Not only that, I can eat
rice with just this awesome sauce alone. Steaming is a very healthy and easy
way to prepare fish. Preparing a perfectly steamed fish just require a little
knowledge. You will get a perfectly steamed fish with this timing:  
Fillets 1 inch (2.5cm) and thicker: check at 10 minutes, add 2 minutes for
every 1/2? (1.3cm) more thickness  
Fillets less than 1 inch (2.5cm): check at 7 minutes  
Super thin fillets: check at 5 minutes  
Check to see if its done at the times indicated. Gently poke at the flesh in
the middle with a chopstick or fork. If flesh flakes easily, then its done. If
flesh sticks together still, then add 1-2 more minutes to cooking time. Also
check to make sure you haven’t run out of steaming water.

This was delicious! And so quick and easy. It felt an indulgent but was still
a nice light meal. I don’t have a steamer or that type of wine in my house, so
I just steamed the fish in a regular pan and used sherry. And it came out
great. Thanks :) will definitely make again!
