Save Recipe

A native Thai woman made this for a Thai cooking class. This is how she
learned to make it from her mother. We tasted the dish and it was great. We
did not have Pad Thai sauce with it but she said the store bought type was
fine. Vegetables or tofu may be substituted for the chicken. She noted that
overcooked noodles do not stir-fry well and do not look good. If using fresh
noodles, instead of dried, they will cook in less than 1 minute.

I doubled the sauce ingredients like others suggested and the dish turned out
amazing. I like to drench my pad thai with lots of lime juice as well.
