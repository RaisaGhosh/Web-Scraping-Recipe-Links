### Notes

Schezwan sauce, made with spicy ingredients, occupies a special place in the
**Chinese cuisine**. While you can use any type of vegetables in this Schezwan
noodles, it tastes great with vegetables like carrots, cabbage, parsley and
capsicum, which are often used in this cuisine. Long and crispy bean sprouts
also highlight the reality of this dish.
