# Tom Kha Gai (Thai Coconut Chicken Soup)

Jump to Recipe*Print Recipe

_Authentic Tom Kha Gai - a simple delicious recipe for one of Thailand's most
popular soups! Full of fragrant Thai ingredients like lemongrass, kaffir lime
leaves, ginger, and galanga root, this Thai Coconut Chicken Soup can be made
on the stovetop or in an Instant Pot. Paleo, Gluten-free and Vegan-adaptable.
**Includes a Video!**_

_I would say that there exist a thousand unbreakable links between each of us
and everything else, and that our dignity and our chances are one. The
farthest star and the mud at our feet are a family; and there is no decency or
sense in honoring one thing, or a few things, and then closing the list. ~Mary
Oliver _

This authentic recipe for Tom Kha Gai (Thai Coconut Chicken Soup) is full of
amazing flavor and can be made quickly and easily on the stovetop or in an
Instant Pot pressure cooker.

What makes this recipe for Tom Kha Gai recipe truly authentic, is the use of
**galangal root. **

## **_What Does Tom Kha Gai mean?_**  

Tom Kha Gai translates to Chicken Soup with Galangal.  Tom means SOUP, Kha
means GALANGAL and Gai means Chicken.

So Galangal root is the star of the dish. And believe me, it will elevate.
Galangal is hard to find at regular grocery stores and may require a trip to
your local Asian Market, but trust me when I tell you, you'll love yourself
for it. So will your family.

And what is nice is, you can buy extra galangal root and kaffir lime leaves
and freeze them for future use, because I promise you'll want to make this
soup again. Soon!

The rich, fragrant coconut broth is especially comforting when feeling under
the weather.

## _What is Galangal Root?  _

Galangal root (also called galanga)  looks very much like ginger but tastes
_very very_ different. It has an exotic pine flavor, that in my opinion,
totally makes the soup. Like I mentioned above, the word Kha means galangal.
So don't make the soup, until you have time to go to the Asian Market.  Trust
me.  üòâ

While you are there, pick up some kaffir lime leaves, fresh ginger and
lemongrass. Both the galangal and the kaffir lime leaves may be in the frozen
section of the market. You may also find chopped _frozen_ lemongrass, which I
happen to love because then there is always some on hand in the freezer.

While I haven't made a vegan version of this yet, I know it is possible using
tofu (or fried tofu) and this vegan fish sauce.

## **_Tom Yum vs Tom Kha  _**

The primary difference between Tom Yum and Tom Kha is that Tom Kha is richer
and creamier with the addition of coconut milk. Tom Yum Soup is brothy, spicy,
and sour and typically made with a spicy paste. Tom Kha is rich and creamy,
with sweeter notes.

You'll need about a quarter cup of both galangal and ginger and just a heads
up- you don't need to peel the ginger or the galangal, just thinly slice.
There are some who believe ginger doesn't belong in Tom Kha, but I still like
to add both. Up to you.

Thai red chilies are a nice addition to the soup too, but you can also use
chili paste.

Make the Tom Kha Gai in an Instant Pot with chicken breast or chicken thighs,
or cook it more authentically on the stovetop. Your choice!

The instant pot version is very quick and easy- just put it all in the pot and
set.

When it's done squeeze with fresh lime and serve in bowls. Feel free to add
cilantro.

Enjoy this Tom Kha Gai - a warming Coconut Chicken soup that is full of
amazing Thai flavor.

Learn how to make authentic Tom Kha Gai (Thai Coconut Chicken Soup) with this
simple delicious recipe. Can be made in an Instant Pot or on the stove top.
Gluten-free and vegan adaptable! Updated 3/20 ( see notes)

  * **Author:** Sylvia Fountaine
  * **Prep Time:** 10
  * **Cook Time:** 20
  * **Total Time:** 30 minutes
  * **Yield:** 8 cups ( 4 servings)
  * **Category:** soup, gluten-free, vegan-adaptable
  * **Method:** instant pot, stove top, pressure cooker
  * **Cuisine:** Thai

### Ingredients

  * 1 -2 shallots, diced
  * ¬º cup ginger, sliced into ‚Öõ inch thick disks, skins ok ( 2 inch piece)
  * ¬º cup galangal root, sliced into ‚Öõ thick disks, skins ok ( 2 inch piece)
  * 3 tablespoons finely chopped lemongrass- or use lemongrass paste.
  * 8 kaffir lime leaves
  * 2 cups chicken broth or veggie broth
  * 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken- whole breasts or thighs (or sub 1 pound crispy Tofu)
  * 8 ounces mushrooms (oyster, shiitake, cremini, or straw mushrooms) or sub other veggies like bell pepper, snow peas, etc.
  * 2-4 fresh Thai Chilies, or add chili paste to taste at the end
  * 3 tablespoons fish sauce (or sub vegan fish sauce)
  * 1 ¬Ω teaspoons salt

---------

  * 2 x 14-ounce cans of coconut milk (full fat)
  * 3 tablespoons lime juice ( 1-2 small limes) to taste
  * 2 teaspoons palm, coconut or brown sugar

Serve this on its own, over rice or rice noodles!

### Instructions

**Instant Pot Instructions:**

  * Place everything in the instant pot **except lime juice, coconut milk and sugar** - leaving the chicken thighs or breasts whole. Don't forget the salt. Give a stir. üôÇ
  * If using chicken breasts, pressure cook on _high pressure_ for 7 minutes, or 10 minutes for thighs. If using tofu, pressure cook 4 minutes.
  * Naturally release for 10-15 minutes. Shred the chicken into bite sized pieces using two forks and add the coconut milk, sugar and lime juice. Taste- adjust salt, lime and spicy heat. Serve with a lime wedge.

**Stove Top Cooking instructions:**

  * Slice the chicken into thin bitesized pieces ( across the grain) and season with salt and pepper and set aside.
  * In large heavy bottom pot or dutch oven, saute shallot in a little oil over medium heat. Add ginger, lemongrass, lime leaves and galalagal and **_2 cups broth_ **and simmer gently for 5 minutes, letting the broth infuse. Add the chicken (or tofu) and mushrooms and gently poach, simmering for 3-4 minutes or until chicken is just cooked through. Stir in the coconut milk, fish sauce, chilies, and salt and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the lime juice and sugar. Taste. Adjust salt and lime and the spice level by adding more chili paste.

### Notes

It may smell "fishy" at first, but after you add the lime juice, it will all
balance and mellow out.

**When making the stove top version** , sometimes I'll poach whole chicken
breasts in the infused broth (covered) then shred with 2 forks- a little
longer cooking time, but no pre-cutting required. Then add the remaining
ingredients. üôÇ

Boiling coconut milk will take some it's lovely sweetness away, so don't over
boil it or over cook it, just simmer gently and not for too long. üôÇ

**To make a vegan version,** sub veggie broth for the chicken broth. Add
crispy tofu. ( Pan- sear cubes of tofu in a skillet, with olive oil, salt and
pepper) Add other veggies if you like! Sub vegan fish sauce for regular fish
sauce.

Feel free to serve over rice or rice noodles.

**RECIPE UPDATE:** I changed the Instant Pot version, to add the 2 cans of
coconut milk AFTER pressure cooking. Some folks were having issues with the
coconut milk curdling during the pressure cooking.

What you you recommend freezing the leftovers of this dish or no?

I'm not sure Tara- I personally have not tried freezing. It should be ok?
Coconut milk may separate, but give agood stir.

This was delicious! I think it would have been even better if I‚Äôd had
everything as recommended. I had to substitute bonito flakes since I didn‚Äôt
have fish sauce. The galangal and makrut lime leaves really do make the flavor
pop! 3/4 kids, husband, and I highly approved. I‚Äôm going to try this again
when I‚Äôve gotten some fish sauce and will try it to accompany pad Thai as
these are my favorite Thai dishes.

Very delicious soup. One of my favourite soups. It has an authentic Thai
taste.  
When I put the coriander in at the end, it just brought it to life.  
I‚Äôll definately be making this again.  
Thanks for the recipe

I made this tonight, added mushrooms and omitted the chili's cause I wasn't in
the mood for the heat. I've tried other Tom kha Gai recipes and THIS is the
one I'm keeping.

This recipe is so delicious, so tasty, so easy to make! I have made this
recipe several times and each time it taste better. Give it a try, but you
must use the galangal root. You can find all the ingredients on Amazon, and
then freeze for future use as I have done. My compliments to the Chef!!

This soup was such a hit- amazing flavors and textures! While ingredient prep
was not quick, the process of cooking it on the stovetop was a breeze. I added
extra fish sauce and lime juice for depth of flavor.

Our favorite thai restaurant has a to die for Tom Kha that when we do eat out
with usually regular there because of how good it is, and how difficult I
thought it would be to make at home. Thank you for this recipe and breaking
the thought it my mind that it was something I could not replicate at home
because it is 99% spot on! I'm making a second batch now and just need to cook
my noodle a bit longer (which has nothing to do with your recipe) and it will
be PERFECT. I found all ingredients at our asian market thankfully but was
prepared to order it all on amazon because I love tom Kha so much. Next time
will do with shrimp as my family likes that protein as well with this soup.
Thank you for another wonderful recipe! SO glad I found your blog!

My dad is super hard to please and as soon as he tasted this he said, ‚Äúoh wow,
this is so authentic!‚Äù and my whole family loved it. I was worried because the
Asian market I went to was out of lime leaves, but I substituted the zest of
three small limes and two bay leaves and it came out great.

Hello Everyone-

I am writing from Everett, WA‚Ä¶outside of Thailand‚Ä¶. perhaps MORE Thai
restaurants and people from Thailand than anywhere else in the world.

While I have never been to Thailand, I have eaten Tom Kha Gai at more than a
dozen Thai restaurants in the Pacific NW.

Unfortunately, this recipe IS NOT correct.

in addition to the dozens of Thai restaurants in the Pacific NW, we also have
DOZENS of authentic everything Pacific Rim grocery stores.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it did not even come close to what
one can find at (for example) Tasters Wok in Lynnwood, WA.

IT WAS WAY TO SALTY. (I use RED BOAT #40 Fish Sauce)

If you try this recipe, PLEASE do not add the 1.5 t salt and limit the Fish
Sauce to 1 or 2 tablespoons (at first).

BTW, I used organic reduced sodium chicken broth.

I may try this recipe again‚Ä¶. but will first talk to some local Thai cooks to
find out what the error is with this recipe.

I mean no disrespect to Sylvia‚Ä¶. I am merely trying to pass on my findings to
everyone.

The ingredients are not cheap‚Ä¶ so be advised.

Good Luck!

I love this soup. Previous attempts, using different recipes, were
disappointing. This recipe is excellent. I actually have a kefir lime plant
that a co-worker found for me a couple of years ago when we were both into
Thai cooking. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. My local Central
Market carries all the rest of the aromatics so assembling the ingredients was
not difficult. I already had some button mushrooms that I needed to use or
throw away so I used them and they were fine but I will definitely try one of
the more exotic type mushrooms when I make it next time.
