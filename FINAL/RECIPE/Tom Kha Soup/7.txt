This Tom Kha is a classic Thai coconut soup made easy! It's paleo-friendly,
whole30, and can easily be made vegan and vegetarian.

## What is Tom Kha Soup?

Tom Kha soup is a delicious Thai classic, that's essentially a coconut soup.
It's made with broth, coconut milk, vegetables, seasonings like curry paste,
and often a protein like chicken or shrimp. I love the chicken soup version of
this soup, Tom Kha Gai, but you can easily make this soup with or without a
protein!

This Tom Kha Soup is a vegetarian version of the classic, that can easily be
modified to add protein if desired. It's paleo, whole30, and vegetarian.
Perfect for a nourishing meal or side dish on a cool day!

#### The Ingredients

  * **Broth & coconut milk. **Canned coconut milk is best for this recipe. I like to use Native Forest "Simple" coconut milk.
  * **Shitake mushrooms.** You can use other varieties of mushrooms, but shiitake mushrooms are best!
  * **Shredded carrots**
  * **Onion, ginger, garlic, curry paste and lemongrass.** To keep it nightshade-free, swap curry paste for turmeric, or leave it out altogether for a more coconut flavored soup.

# How to make this Easy Tom Kha Soup

  * **Cook the vegetables:** Add the onion and saute for 3-5 minutes, or until translucent. Add the ginger and garlic and saute for another 2-3 minutes. Add the carrots and shitake mushrooms and saute for 3-4 minutes or until slightly soft.

  * **Add the liquids and seasonings:** Pour in the broth, coconut milk, fish sauce, coconut aminos, lime juice, and seasonings (reserving the cilantro) and mix well to combine. Bring to a low simmer and allow to simmer for 15-20 minutes. Remove the lemongrass.
  * **Serve:** topped with cilantro and additional lime wedges to serve.

### Is Tom Kha Soup Healthy?

"Healthy" is always subjective, but considering this recipe is packed with
vegetables, we think it's pretty healthy!

### How to make this soup vegan and vegetarian

This recipe is a vegan/vegetarian soup, but to keep it that way, make sure to
use a vegetable broth and omit the fish sauce! I like to use chicken broth,
but veggie broth works just fine.

### What proteins can you add to this recipe?

Chicken is the classic pairing to this recipe, but you can also use shrimp!
All you have to do is precook the chicken until cooked through, and re-add it
back to the soup as it simmers for flavor. To add shrimp, you can cook the
shrimp while the soup simmers.



### Can you make Tom Kha Soup nightshade-free & AIP?

Yes! I have a totally AIP version with chicken in my cookbook, but you can
also make this version nightshade-free by omitting the curry paste. It will
change the color of the soup, but it will still have lots of flavor!

This looks really yummy. Is there a good substitute for the fish sauce?

    * **Michelle** -- December 30, 2019 @ 4:21 pm  Reply

You can do more coconut aminos ðŸ™‚

  2. **Alysia** -- July 22, 2020 @ 5:49 am  Reply

This soup was absolutely amazing!!!!! I just added bok choy, chicken, shrimp
and Thai chili peppers to give it a kick! Honestly wayyyy better then getting
it at a restaurant . This will definitely be a keep!!!

  3. **Jc** -- October 5, 2020 @ 12:45 pm  Reply

What kind of coconut milk do you use?

    * **Michelle** -- October 6, 2020 @ 7:57 pm  Reply

I like native forest "simple" coconut milk in a can ðŸ™‚

  4. **Joanna** -- November 11, 2020 @ 1:24 pm  Reply

This soup is sooo good! And pretty easy to make especially when you already
have some broth left. I love all of your recipes but this one is one of my
favourite

What are we supposed to do with the lemongrass?? It doesnâ€™t mention it at all
in the instructions.

    * **Sarah Wolfe** -- October 16, 2021 @ 8:03 pm  Reply

The lemongrass is one of the "seasonings" mentioned in step 4. I usually
substitute lemongrass paste.

    * **danielle** -- October 26, 2021 @ 3:11 pm  Reply

Wondering the same thing!

    * **Unbound Wellness** -- November 29, 2021 @ 4:25 pm  Reply

It should be included in the seasonings in step 4!

  6. **Annie** -- July 30, 2021 @ 1:46 am  Reply

I loved this recipe! I made some easy subs like adding chopped bok choy,
adding more fish sauce, using ground ginger (realized I was out of fresh once
I started cooking), and using baby portobellos. It was SO good! It was good
because I didnâ€™t feel like I was missing out on anything even though I made it
AIP. Thank you for this!

It looks amazing. I love tom kha soup but it is often way to spicy for me.
This sounds like it would be heavenly!

When did you add the bok choy, shrimp and chicken? Do you sautÃ© them with the
carrots and mushrooms?

      * **Unbound Wellness** -- February 24, 2022 @ 8:49 pm  Reply

All you have to do is precook the chicken until cooked through, and re-add it
back to the soup as it simmers for flavor. To add shrimp, you can cook the
shrimp while the soup simmers.

This is sooooo good and easy!! The only thing I would do is double or triple!

Easy and delicious! This is one of my favorite soups to get at Thai-now I can
make it myself!!

Sorry, I'm super confused. You said this recipe is vegetarian/vegan, but are
using fish sauce. Is it a vegan substitute? I really want to try this recipe
true to how it's written, but need clarification since one of the people I'd
be making it for is vegan.

    * **Unbound Wellness** -- March 17, 2022 @ 8:33 pm  Reply

You can omit the fish sauce or use coconut aminos instead!

  11. **S.** -- February 23, 2022 @ 11:47 pm  Reply

Super fast and easy recipe but very delicious! I put extra lime in mine ðŸ™‚ I
usually use paleorunningmomma recipes, but I think I have converted! These
recipes are easier, accurate, and more delish!

What type of curry paste is used here? Do you recommend a particular brand?  
TIA

  12. **Alecia** -- February 26, 2022 @ 9:18 pm  Reply

What type of curry paste is being used here? Is it Thai curry paste? If so
what kind? Red or yellow?  
TIA!

    * **Unbound Wellness** -- March 15, 2022 @ 6:39 pm  Reply

I use red curry paste!

  13. **Beth** -- May 11, 2022 @ 11:43 pm  Reply

This recipe is on repeat in our house, so delish! Quick tip to save time: I
use my mini chopper to dice the carrots, onions, garlic and ginger. Boom! ðŸ™‚ I
love using scissors to cut the cilantro over the top of bowls too. Also
zucchini or other mild veggies also are a great addition.

I'm planning to make this tonight for a guest, but can you tell me if this is
gluten free? I'm not experienced with that particular dietary restriction, but
my guest is gluten free!  
Literally can't waitâ€¦.I love tom kha soup!

    * **Unbound Wellness** -- May 31, 2022 @ 4:25 pm  Reply

All the recipes on Unbound Wellness are gluten-free, so this soup definitely
is! Enjoy!!
