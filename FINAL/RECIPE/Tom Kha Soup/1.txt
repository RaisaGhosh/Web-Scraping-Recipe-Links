This silky, aromatic soup is a complete meal in a bowl. The recipe comes from
Long Grain restaurant in Camden, ME.

## Ingredients

6 Servings

1

1” piece ginger, peeled

10

makrut (Thai) lime leaves or 1 Tbsp. lime zest and ¼ cup lime juice

6

cups low-sodium chicken broth

1½

lb. skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1” pieces

8

oz. shiitake, oyster, or maitake mushrooms, stemmed, caps cut into bite-size
pieces

1

13.5-oz. can coconut milk

2

Tbsp. fish sauce (such as nam pla or nuoc nam)

1

tsp. sugar

2

stalks fresh lemongrass, tough outer layers removed

Chili oil, cilantro leaves with tender stems, and lime wedges (for serving)

## Preparation

### Step 1

Using the back of a knife, lightly smash lemongrass and ginger; cut lemongrass
into 4” pieces. Bring lemongrass, ginger, lime leaves, and broth to a boil in
a large saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors are melded, 8–10
minutes. Strain broth into clean saucepan; discard solids.

### Step 2

Add chicken and return to a boil. Reduce heat, add mushrooms, and simmer,
skimming occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and mushrooms are soft,
20–25 minutes. Mix in coconut milk, fish sauce, and sugar.

### Step 3

Divide soup among bowls. Serve with chili oil, cilantro, and lime wedges.

  * STOWN's is a good description of how to make it. I used Blue Oyster mushrooms and cooked the 30 min - perfect. I used 3 cups of stock, not 6. I used two Thai chilis instead of chili oil. That's just my preference. My wife went nuts and wants it once a week. At that rate I'm going to have to use cheaper mushrooms. I will use white beech mushrooms that are only 3.99 instead of 10.00. I used Grace canned coconut. I find there's a huge variation in canned coconut. I shake the can and if it seems too liquidy, I move on, looking for nice thick coconut. Fresh lemongrass makes a difference. My lemongrass was old and not very strong.

  * WORST coconut soup recipe I have tried, and I’ve tried a lot. WAY to many mushrooms, altered the taste of the whole thing. Luckily I had more like juice, ginger and lemon grass on hand to help. My family took one bite and was done.

  * Sub ginger with finely sliced galangal. Use three cups chicken stock per can of coconut not six. Or be prepared to cook down for about an hour or so. And use button mushrooms not shitake. Otherwise on point.

  * This has got to be the WORST version of Tom Kha Gai that I've ever tasted. Way too much lime juice, wrong choice of mushrooms (the ones listed take around 40-60 minutes to cook through, not 25) and the use of ginger is inappropriate.

  * THIS recepi is totally wrong... in many ways but the biggest mistake is: "kha" in the title means GALANGA and not GINGER. totally different flavor.

  * I started making this then read the comments about using the Thai replacement of ginger (forget name) so I ran to store and got some. I used both ginger and drop of the Thai ginger, and everything else in recipe. But I thought it would be too boring without any veggies so I added about 4 baby book Choy. After eating a meal there was plenty of broth so I’m going to cook more veggies and throw it in tomm. Everything was delicious.

  * Excellent and easy to make. Disagreeing with a comment below: The recipe as written needs more lime. Made this as written after visiting Lotus of Siam in Vegas. It was lacking something compared to Lotus's version. Next time, I doubled the lime and it was better. Last night, I tripled the lime (6 limes worth of zest and juice) and it turned out great. I also recommend going in on a very spicy chili oil. The heat is key.

  * your viewers are correct.... THIS IS MY TO GO TOM KHA GAI COCOUNT SOUP... you need to start with 2 tbl Coconut oil, med heat ....when hot, add l/2 sweet onion, 3 cloves fresh chopped garlic, (do not use the garlic in a jar)..... (order on line the Galangal wood/bark/chips) with out that do not make the soup. I added 15 wood chips of the Galongal wood... Add Lemongrass, or lemongrass paste 2 tbl... and add 2 tbl of red curry paste and 2 tbl of Hot chili oil.. stir for 5 min Blend all together.....Then...add " home made" chicken broth, if possible or Swanson's 2 cups. boil. ... then turn down and simmer uncovered 30 min. Strain.. Take everything out of the chicken broth mixture...save... Then add to the broth, the raw chicken cut up. I used 3 breasts. Boil again, then simmer again. Do not add the coconut milk if boiling... Make sure coconut milk you use is in a tin can and not in the milk section. I use 2 cups of coconut milk... do not boil simmer 10 min.... Add the wood chips back in that you strained out...., add mushrooms 8 oz..., and must add 2 Tbl of fish sauce, 4 tbl fresh lime juice, (not the bottled kind) and 2 tbl brown sugar.. Get soup nice and hot but do not boil.... Garnish with green onions sliced thin and fresh cilantro chopped... Yum Yum tell me what you think. I bet you will love it. ( I also put in some cilantro when cooking but took it out before serving)

  * I followed the directions perfectly but something was lacking. Too much lime and I love lime. Lacked richness in flavor, so bummed. Tried to fix but don't know how, very disappointing. Won't do this recipe again.

  * This recipe is not very authentic. Instead of ginger, your supposed to use galangal , that's why it's called tom kha gai. The kha means galangal, which has a totally different flavor profile from ginger. This recipe is totally butchered by western cooks.
