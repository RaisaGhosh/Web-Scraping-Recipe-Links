Seafood, Sweet & Sour

# Sweet and Sour King Prawn Recipe

November 2, 2021 2 comments

Jump to RecipePrint Recipe

In this post, we bring the heavenly taste and vibrant colours of sweet and
sour to seafood, topped with pineapple. This is the taste of happiness, one
that will really wow your guests!

So, sometimes I wonder, why is the sweet and sour flavour so attractive, and
one of the answers I found online is quite intriguing. It states that
sweetness and sourness are two simple chemicals plants can produce and animals
can detect. Therefore, such fruits gain an evolutionary advantage. This traces
back millions of years ago.

Now, I am not sure if this is true or not, but certainly, both sweet and sour
fruits, as well as food, trigger my appetite. My go-to dish for sweet and sour
is, of course, the iconic Sweet & Sour Pork (Á≥ñÈÜãÈáåËÑä t√°ng c√π l«ê j«ê), or the
‚Äúquick and easy‚Äù version of **Sweet & Sour Beef Balls.** __ Sweet and Sour
Prawn Balls (Á≥ñÈÜãËôæÁêÉ t√°ng c√π xiƒÅ qi√∫) is a great alternative when I want
something lighter and more refreshing.

Ok, let‚Äôs get to it.

This authentic Chinese recipe shows you how to make a simple sweet and sour
king prawn dish without the need for store-bought sauce.

### Ingredients

  *  **Main**
  * Fresh Kings Prawn 250g

  * 1/2 of a medium-sized Pineapple

  *  **Batter**
  * 1 medium-sized egg

  * Corn starch 2 tbs

  *  **Sweet & Sour Sauce**
  * Shaoxing Cooking Wine 1 tsp

  * Tomato paste 1 tbs

  * Chinese white rice vinegar 3 tbs

  * Sugar 2 tbs

  * Oyster sauce 1 tsp

  * Corn starch 4 tsp

  * Water 3 tbs

  * Salt to taste

### Directions

  * To make this dish, we need to first prepare our King Prawns. Cut the back open and remove the intestinal tract. This will also help our prawns curl into a nicely rounded ball when cooking.
  * Now we need to marinate the prawns. Add 1 tsp Shaoxing Cooking Wine and 1 tsp Oyster sauce to the prawns and let them marinate.
  * While the prawns are being marinated, let‚Äôs prepare the sweet and sour sauce. Add 1 tbs tomato paste, 3 tbs Chinese white rice vinegar, 2 tbs sugar, 3 tbs water, 1 tsp Shaoxing Cooking Wine, 4 tsp corn starch and salt to taste in a bowl. Mix well and set aside.
  * Prepare half of a pineapple. Remove the core part (which is hard to chew) and cut into 2cm x 2cm x 2cm cubes.
  * Add 2 tbs corn starch and an egg to our marinated prawns with a pinch of salt. Mix well and set aside.
  * Heat up vegetable oil in a small saucepan with medium-high heat (the oil should be deep enough to cover at least half of each prawn). Wait for the oil to warm up. My way of checking is to stick chopsticks in and when I see small bubbles forming around the chopsticks‚Äô tips, I know the oil is ready for frying.
  * Gently place the prawns in one by one after shaking off the excessive batter on the prawn and wait for the outside to harden.
  * After they are all done, transfer them into an air fryer fry for 8 mins at 180 ¬∞C. If you don‚Äôt have an air fryer, fry them a second time over high heat until golden.
  * Heat up 1 tsp of oil in your cooking pot or wok over high heat. Add the pineapple cubes in and stir fry for 2 minutes until softened.
  * Mix the sweet & sour sauce again before adding it to the pineapple in the pot. Keep stirring until it thickens, then add your prawn balls in. Mix well and plate.
  * I garnished mine with chopped spring onions and white sesame seeds. Serve with rice and enjoy üòâ ËØ∑ÊÖ¢Áî® (q«êng m√†n y√≤ng).
