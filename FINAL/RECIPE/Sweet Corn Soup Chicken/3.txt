Sweet Corn Chicken Soup

Sweet Corn Chicken Soup

Sweet corn chicken soup is my most favorite Indo Chinese soup dish. When I eat
Chinese at a restaurant, this heart warming chicken soup or sweet corn
vegetable soup is always a part of our meal. One of the simplest soup recipes
that can be made at home and I guarantee you that this soup will give any good
Indian Chinese restaurant a run for its money. Seriously, its that good.

Basically one needs to follow three crucial steps while making this soup.
These include the use of cream style corn, chicken stock and egg drop that
gives the soup its wonderful texture. The soup has a sweet-salty flavor where
shredded chicken is simmered in a sesame oil toasted chicken broth and cream
style corn. I use white pepper powder to season my soup which lends a subtle
hint of spice. You can also add finely chopped carrots and beans, thought its
purely optional.

One sure shot way to win the heart of your loved ones is to serve them this
flavorful restaurant style sweet corn chicken soup. ðŸ™‚

### Method for making Sweet Corn Chicken Soup

  1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed vessel, add spring onion whites and ginger and saute for a mt. Add the shredded chicken and saute for a mt. Add cream style sweet corn and chicken stock or water and bring to a boil. Reduce flame and cook on low flame for a mt.

  4. Add the cornflour mixture and go on stirring till the soup thickens on low to medium flame. Slowly add the beaten egg and continuously stir in one direction only.

> ### Tips
>
>   * __  Prepare the chicken stock by boiling 1 1/2 lts of water, 3/4 tsp
> salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper powder, 1 cubed carrot, 1/2" ginger, 3 crushed
> garlic cloves and 1/4 kg chicken with bone. Place lid and allow the water to
> come to a rolling boil. Simmer for 15 mins and turn off the flame. Strain
> the liquid and keep aside. De-bone the chicken and shred to small pieces.
>   * __  If you want you can add vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.
> Vegetable stock can be prepared by boiling 6-7 cups of water, 1 large onion
> (quarter it), a carrot (slice it) and a potato (large cubes). Boil till
> water reduces to 5 1/2 cups. Turn off heat, strain the stock and discard
> vegetables.
>   * __  You can use black pepper powder instead of white pepper powder.
>   * __  Sugar can be reduced to 1/2 tablespoon.
>   * __  Adjust corn flour according to the desired thickness of the soup.
> More corn flour yields a thicker soup.
>   * __  You can prepare cream style corn at home. Take 2 corn cobs, take a
> sharp knife to remove the corn kernels. Melt a tbsp of butter in a vessel,
> add 3/4th of the corn kernels and saute for 2 mts. Blend the remaining corn
> kernels to a paste. Add this corn paste and a tbsp of sugar to the vessel
> and mix. Add 1/4 cup of water and 3 tbsps milk (optional ingredient) and
> cook for 7-8 mts. Mix a tbsp of flour in 3 tbsps water and mix. Add the corn
