I simply love this recipe. My 8 yr old daughter tried it for the first time
and she said it was the best dish she had ever tasted. Even my mil who doesnt
like anything sweet in savoury dishes loves this recipe.

Yet again a perfect recipe by Tarla Dalal. The perfect combination of veggies
alongwith boiled noodles and fried noodles to add that crunch to the dish. A
more wholesome and satisfying dish to add that different touch to normal
chienese meal of noodles. A sure shot winner which dont fail to impress the
guests.

Although I find American Chopsuey a rather unhealthy dish due to all the fried
noodles, I could not resist trying this recipe. The aroma of the fried noodles
and the veggies is very appetizing! The balance between the crunchy noodles
and the boiled ones is perfect.
