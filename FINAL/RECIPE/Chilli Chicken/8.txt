Chilli Chicken Recipe

Chilli Chicken is a mouth-watering Indo Chinese chicken recipe, here fried
chicken is cooked in the combination of Indian vegetables and Chinese flavors
and turned into delicious and simply irresistible main course dish, which can
be also served as a starter.

Chilli Chicken Recipe is a popular Chicken Starter or Appetizer from the Indo-
chinese cuisine. Here boneless chicken (fillets or cubes) are marinated in
Egg, Cornflour, Maida and Salt and then deep fried and seasoned in sauces to
get the best Chinese chilli chicken.

Chilli Chicken tastes hot, sweet and sour, because of Soy Sauce, Chilli Sauce
and Vinegar. This famous Chinese Dish is best to serve with Fried rice and
Hakka noodles. You can browse several Indo-Chinese Recipes and Chicken Recipes
in my blog, this one is one of my favorites. This Chili Chicken Recipe is
famous in restaurants and there they usually use Ajjinomotto (Monosodium
glutamate) to give a unique flavor, but I haven't used Ajinomotto and my
chilli chicken recipe still it tastes great.

Eggs are very necessary to add during marination, it helps to keep the chicken
moist and tender. Eggs also helps in binding the flour well and gives a good
crust. An alternate to food color is using a good red chili powder like
kashmiri or bedgi. Lets start making **chilli chicken recipe**.

## Chilli Chicken Recipe - Step by Step

Following are the ingredients required for making Chilli Chicken Recipe.
Boneless Chicken, All purpose Flour (Cornflour), Maida, Spring Onion White,
Spring Onion Greens, Capsicum, Green Chilies, Curry Leaves, Ginger, Garlic,
Soy Sauce, Red Chili Sauce.

Slit the Green Chilies. Slice the Capsicum, make some cubes of white spring
onion and finely chop the greens of spring onion. Arrange the veggies and keep
aside.Break the egg and put it in a bowl along with pieces of boneless
chicken. Add 2 tablespoon Cornflour and 5 tablespoon Maida and mix well.Add
Salt and Red Chili Powder and mix it thoroughly.Mix all the ingredients
properly and keep them aside for 10-15 minutes.Shallow Fry the chicken in non-
stick pan. You can also deep fry chicken but deep frying will make chicken
more oily. I prefer shallow frying chicken. Allow the chicken pieces to fry
for 2-3 minutes on each side on medium heat, keep flipping chicken in between
till its gold brown.Cook the chicken pieces on both sides for few minutes.
**TIR Chef Tip:** Cover the pan with lid and cook chicken for 2 more minutes.
This will make chicken little crispy and moist from inside.See, how the
chicken has turn gold brown. Make sure you don't over cook chicken, otherwise
it will become hard from inside. Take out the chicken and keep it aside for
few minutes before making chilli chicken. **TIR Chef Tip:** You can also cut
this chicken in smaller pieces, these pieces can also be used in chicken Hakka
noodles, chicken fried rice and of course for making chilli chicken.

Let us now prepare CornStarch. Take a cup and add 100ml water, 1 tablespoon
cornflour in it, mix it well till all the cornflour is dissolved in the water.
Heat 2 tablespoon oil in pan and add Onion cubes, Slitted Green Chillies,
Capsicum, Curry Pata leaves, Ginger and Garlic. Toss all the ingredients on
high flame for 2-3 minutes and then add Soy Sauce, Red Chilli Sauce and
Cornstarch in it.Add Soy Sauce.

Add Red Chilli Sauce and keep mixing to blend the sauces. Cook all the
ingredients for 1-2 minutes, till gravy become thick.Once gravy becomes little
thicker, add fried pieces of chicken, 1/4 tablespoon vinegar and one cup
finely chopped green spring onions.Cook for 1-2 minutes and now your Chilli
Chicken is ready. **Tir Chef Tips:** If you want to make chilli chicken very
dry then you may skip adding cornstarch and add 1 tablespoon tomato ketchup in
it. If you want to make chilli chicken in gravy then add 200ml of water while
preparing corn starch.

Here is my Chilli Chicken Dry. Do let me know, how was your chilli chicken in

I tried making this at home but my chicken was not cooked properly and it came
out watery, can you please tell what I was doing wrong?

Hi Anu,  
I think you might have added more beaten eggs and soya sauce in the marinade
in which chicken pieces are to be coated. In such case, you can increase the
quantity of cornstarch. Also after rinsing the chicken pieces, keep them in
strainer for some time to drain the whole water. While frying the chicken
pieces, fry them on low flame, till the chicken is cooked properly. Hopefully
it will help.
