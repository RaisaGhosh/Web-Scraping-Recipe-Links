Crunchy broccoli and versatile baby corn find their home in a garlicky gravy
that is perked up with Schezuan sauce and tomato ketchup. The intermixing of
flavours, ranging from the pungency of garlic and the spiciness of green
chillies to the tanginess of the sauces is quite exciting, making the Hot
Garlic Sauce with Baby Corn and Broccoli a real attention grabber on any menu.

I love this spicy garlic sauce, with perfectly cooked baby corn and broccoli,
which gives a nice crunch. I Served the gravy on top of vegetable fried rice
and added fried noodles.It was yumm.
