# Baby Corn & Beans in Hot Garlic Sauce

Posted by Chef With No Hat on September 10, 2017

Itâ€™s been a long time since Iâ€™ve posted something. Very busy these days, so
Iâ€™m gonna keep it short and sweet this time, with an amazing recipe for
dinner, and my favourite too, Iâ€™m talking about Chinese!!! #drooling

This recipe is inspired from hot garlic sauce, so I thought of making baby
corns and French beans in hot garlic sauce.

So, hereâ€™s the recipe!



Ingredients:

2-3 tbsp oil

15-20 cloves garlic, finely chopped

1 small piece ginger, finely chopped

2 green chillies, chopped

2 onions, diced

Â½ cup French beans, chopped

8-10 baby corns, boiled, cut into half

1 capsicum, diced

Salt & Pepper, to taste

2-3 tbsp soya sauce

1 tsp vinegar

1 cup corn stock, or as required

2 tbsp corn flour



Recipe:

  1. Heat oil in a pan, and add garlic, ginger, and green chillies to it. Cook till the garlic turns light brown and then add onions and sautÃ©.
  2. Add beans, fry and then add baby corns and capsicum.
  3. Add salt, pepper powder, soy sauce, vinegar and sautÃ© to release the aroma.
  4. To make a gravy add the baby corn stock, which was used to boil baby corns, and after it boils, make slurry of corn flour, add it to the gravy to thicken it.
  5. Serve hot with some rice.
