Lisa Nicklin for The New York Times

This Shanghainese noodle recipe, from the British cook and food writer Fuchsia
Dunlop, can be made vegetarian by omitting the pork. Do seek out light and
dark soy sauces; light soy sauce adds salty-umami flavor and dark soy sauce
adds color.

Traditional woks are made from carbon steel, and must be routinely seasoned to
keep from rusting. To season, heat the wok on high, turn off the flame and use
a paper towel to wipe the interior with vegetable oil. Repeat if necessary. A
deep frying pan with high sides will work for this recipe if you don't have a
wok. --Sara Bonisteel

### Preparation

  1. Cut the pork evenly into 1/4-inch slices, then into 1/8-inch slivers.
  2. In a small bowl, combine 1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce, the Shaoxing wine, the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon cold water and mix well. Add pork and marinate until ready to cook.
  3. Bring a large, deep pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook for 2 minutes. Turn the cooked noodles into a colander and rinse with cold water. Shake them dry and toss with a splash of oil, stirring thoroughly to prevent sticking.
  4. In a small bowl, combine remaining light soy sauce, the dark soy sauce and the chicken stock and set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large, seasoned wok over high heat until oil just begins to smoke. Add pork, leaving the marinade behind, and stir-fry swiftly to separate. When they are just cooked, remove from wok and set aside.
  5. Clean and re-season the wok, if necessary, then return it to high heat with the remaining oil. Add noodles and soy sauce mixture and stir-fry until piping hot. Add bok choy or spinach and continue to stir-fry briefly until wilted. Stir in the pork and season to taste with salt and white pepper. Serve.
