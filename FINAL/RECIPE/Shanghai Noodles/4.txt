# Stir-Fried Shanghai Noodles

Today's Parent

36

Makes

2 to 4 servings

Photo: LauriPatterson/iStockphoto

We actually fought over the last few forkfuls of this dish. Every single one
of the kids loved it, even 5-year-old Maddie, one tough customer. Shanghai
noodles (a thick oriental noodle) can be found in any Asian grocery store and
many supermarkets. They come in a plastic package, pre-cooked and
refrigerated. I always keep an extra package or two on hand in the freezer.
Recipe winner: Lily Lim Mount Albert, Ontario

##  Ingredients

  * 2 tbsp vegetable oil 
  * 1 garlic clove , chopped 
  * 1 tsp salt 
  * 3 to 5 cups thinly sliced cabbage 
  * 1 cup Chinese barbecued pork , (or regular ham) 
  * 1 400-g pkg fresh Shanghai noodles 
  * 2 tbsp oyster sauce 
  * 1 tbsp sodium-reduced soy sauce 

## Instructions

  * Remove noodles from the package and soak briefly in boiling water to loosen. Drain thoroughly and set aside. (You may want to cut these long noodles up if your kids are very young.)
  * Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet or wok. Add salt and garlic, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add cabbage; stir-fry until tender – about 2 or 3 minutes. Throw in the pork or ham, stir to heat, then toss in the Shanghai noodles.
  * Stir-fry for just a couple of minutes, until thoroughly heated, then add the oyster sauce and soy sauce, mixing well. Serve immediately.
