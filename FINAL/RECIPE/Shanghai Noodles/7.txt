# Shanghai Noodles (Easy & Authentic)

Welcome to Day one of my 3rd series, **15-Minute Dinner for 15 Days** where I
will be sharing Easy & Authentic Asian recipes. I wanted to go back to what
started my food journey seven years ago, where I was a student on a tight
schedule and needed quick and easy meals. There is nothing wrong with a good
old stir-fry, but I wanted to mix it up and remake classic Asian dishes in
less than 15 minutes for days that you are tempted to order take out but don‚Äôt
wait to pay $15 in service charges.

**_I am also committed to emailing out the ingredient list every night at 10
PM PST to all cook together. Make sure to subscribe to my exclusive newsletter
at TIFFYCOOKS.COM to get all the daily grocery list for the next 15 days!_**

**Day 1 will be one of my all-time favorite - Shanghai Noodles. This
underrated dish is so good you will never want Panda Express‚Äôs Chow Mein ever
again.** Feel free to switch out the protein base on your liking, I have tried
it with chicken, shrimp, and tofu in the past, and it all works well with the
stir-fry sauce. For those that can‚Äôt access Shanghai Noodles, use Frozen Udon
instead. Use the same method I taught before you pour hot water over the Udon
and let it sit till you can separate it by hand; this will help prevent the
udon from overcooking.

**60 SECOND VIDEO TUTORIAL:**

**Easy Shanghai Noodles Ingredients**

1 lb of Pork sliced thinly (I used Pork Lion)

2 tbsp of Soy Sauce

1 tsp of White Pepper

1 tbsp of Corn Starch

¬Ω Cabbage sliced

8 Shiitake Mushroom sliced

2 packs of Shanghai Noodles (400g)

Sauce Mixture:

2 tbsp of Soy Sauce

1.5 tbsp of Dark Soy Sauce

1 tbsp of Oyster Sauce or Vegetarian Oyster Sauce

1 tsp of Sugar

¬Ω cup of Chicken Stock or Vegetable Stock

  1. Marinate pork with soy sauce, white pepper, and corn starch while you prepare the veggies. 
  2. Turn the heat to medium-high and drizzle in some oil. Once the pan is hot, add in the cabbage first, followed up by the sliced pork, add the mushroom and finally add in the noodles. Drizzle on the sauce and put the lid on to let it cook for 6-8 minutes. 

  3. After 6-8 minutes, the liquid should be soaked in the noodles, mix everything. 

  4. Turn the heat to high and saute the noodles for another 2-3minutes. 

  5. Optional, but HIGHLY recommended, drizzle on Homemade Chilli Oil.

ENJOY!

Hi! I am Tiffy and I am a HUGE foodie. I love to cook, I love to eat, and I
love sharing what I love with the world.  
I was born in Taiwan, a country with some of the best street food in the
world. When I think back to my childhood, I remember all the fantastic
restaurants my dad brought me to when I was young. You see, my family is also
huge foodies; we use to wander around night markets every weekend, skip the
last period in class to try out new restaurants, and every summer, we would
travel around Taiwan exploring all the new ‚Äúmust try‚Äù dishes around the
country.
