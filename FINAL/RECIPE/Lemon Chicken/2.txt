**Lemon chicken recipe, an easy Indo chinese chicken starter recipe with step
by step photos.** This lemon chicken recipe yields tender chicken bites with a
dominant flavor of lemon juice, mint and mild spices. Slightly tangy, mildly
hot with full of flavors. It makes a great starter for parties or get together
and can also be served as a side to a main course.

* * *

Since lemon chicken is a fusion food it pairs well with **Indo chinese foods**
like veg fried rice, schezwan fried rice, veg noodles, egg fried rice, egg
noodles or hakka noodles. It can also be served with any rice dishes like
jeera rice, peas pulao, or with plain rice and rasam.

I haven't used lemon zest since i did not have. If you like the flavor you can
add a pinch of the powdered zest towards the end.

## Preparation for lemon chicken

1\. Add chicken cubes or entire breast, ginger paste, red chili powder, salt,
turmeric, lemon juice, lemon zest and oil. Do not skip oil, it is the key to
tenderize chicken along with lemon juice. I used half of a large lemon. I
suggest using fresh lemon and freshly ground ginger or grated ginger.

2\. Marinate the chicken and set aside for at least 1 hour 15 minutes. If
using a meat mallet or a metal meat tenderizer, marination time can be reduced
to 40 minutes. It can also be left overnight in the refrigerator.

## How to make lemon chicken recipe

3\. Add little oil to the hot pan, fry chopped ginger and garlic.

4\. When ginger garlic begins to smell good, add onions, chili, sugar and
salt.

5\. Fry until the onions turn transparent.

6\. Add marinated chicken along with lemon juice. Turn down the flame to low,
Stir and fry till the chicken is half cooked.

7\. Sprinkle garam masala or cajun spice mix or all spice. I used a flavorful
garam masala powder. But earlier i have also made this with cajun spice that
is used to make fried chicken and it yielded good results. Mix and fry until
you begin to smell the masala good, for about 2 to 3 minutes.

8\. Pour soya sauce and cook till the chicken is soft cooked. Sauce should be
absorbed by now. Taste the chicken and adjust spice powder, red chili powder
or salt as needed. Add more if needed. With an addition of all these the
sourness from lemon juice gets balanced.

9\. Add finely chopped pudina/mint leaves or celery and fry until the leaves
wilt.

10. Chicken should look moist, tender and soft cooked now. Switch off the stove.

Garnish lemon chicken with fresh mint leaves. Serve with onion wedges.

Hi Swasthi,

I always refer to your recipes when I cook something different. I tried this
dish as a starter for some guests. Left the chicken marinate overnight. The
dish turned out so yummy that I got barely to taste it. All my guests are it
and appreciated the flavours very much.

Please keep posting new things.

Thank you,

This is a very good recipe.  
I made it twice, the first time as it is written, the second with some
modifications. I am reporting them so maybe someone will find them useful:  
-the second time I used 2 tablespoons of yogurt + 1 teaspoon oil instead of 1 1/2 tablespoon oil. I wanted to see if I could bring some of the oil down. It worked for me.  
-I am always looking for methods to cut onion and garlic away from recipes because unfortunately they irritate my stomach (due to medicines my stomach is sensitive). So I didn't use onion and garlic and in their place I started the recipe with a tadka of 1/2 teaspoon cumin seed + 1/4 teaspoon asafoetida and then, when frying the chili, a pinch of turmeric. I think it was good.  
-I didn't try this but I would be interested in using tamarind instead of soy sauce.

As always thank you Swasthi, your recipes are very good!

Hi Swathi,

We don't get Soya sauce, what should I use instead. Or can we make it without
it ?

Please advise ðŸ™‚

Cheers!

Hi Sreenath  
this is a Indo chinese recipe, so soya sauce is being used. Yes you can skip
it and make a indian style dish, use a bit more of garam masala and chili
powder to suit your taste.

Hey Swati  
I m cooking chicken for the first time.  
I need to know that when is chicken half cooked or full cooked n thanks for
the recipe.

Hi Arsh  
Chicken is partially cooked or half cooked when the color of the meat turns
pale white And when you prick with a fork, you can feel the texture - it is
hard.  
When it is fully cooked you can just cut the chicken with a fork, it will be
soft and gets separated from the bone or from the rest of the piece easily.
Hope this helps
