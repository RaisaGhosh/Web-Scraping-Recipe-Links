Our easy lemon chicken recipe shines with a sunny, lemony zing. Garlic and
herbs‚Äîplus a glug of white wine‚Äîmean that these juicy, tender chicken breasts
are as delicious as they are healthy.

## A Healthy, Baked Chicken Breast That‚Äôs Anything but Boring (We Promise!)  

Lemon chicken is really just a simple baked chicken recipe, jazzed up with
some punchy ingredients that add lots of flavor without taking away from how
super-healthy baked chicken breasts are. Our lemon chicken recipe is fast and
easy‚Äîa recipe you might turn to on a busy weeknight when you need dinner to be
simple as it can be. It‚Äôs also a great one to include in your weekend meal-
prep (if you do that kind of thing) because one of the many reasons we love
lemon chicken breasts is their versatility. Having a container of them in the
fridge, all baked and ready to go, means you‚Äôve got the makings of lots of
meals! They can anchor a simple and healthy lunch salad, and are delicious
sliced up into hearty sandwiches‚Äîones where the bread is slathered with mayo
and Homemade Pesto‚Äîfor dinner, too.

## A Flavor-Giving Trifecta Makes this the Best Lemon Chicken Recipe, Ever.

Let‚Äôs start with the good news: lean and protein-packed, boneless, skinless
chicken breast is super healthy! The bad news: boneless, skinless chicken
breast is kind of bland! The solution? Use the chicken breast as a blank
canvas for all of your favorite big flavors, without undermining its‚Äô inherent
healthfulness. Our lemon chicken recipe does all of that thanks to a few of
our favorite big, bright flavors:

  * Lemon, three ways. We aren‚Äôt messing around‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt just lemon chicken. It‚Äôs LEMON chicken! We use lemon zest, fresh-squeezed lemon juice and whole lemon slices to give this lemon chicken recipe all of the citrusy punch that we possibly can. 
  * Garlic, two ways. We could maybe have called this lemon garlic chicken, since our recipe calls for both fresh garlic cloves and (you guessed it) our beloved garlic powder. 
  * Herbs, herbs and more herbs. A whole garden‚Äôs worth of fragrance and flavor, all from a few dried herbs that you probably already have in your pantry. 

## How To Make Lemon Chicken

Our easy, baked lemon chicken recipe is healthy, fast, and so, so delicious.
The key is coating the lemon chicken with lots of moisture-giving things, and
watching that internal temp closely so that you don‚Äôt over-bake the chicken.

  1. Make a lemon chicken marinade. Well, it‚Äôs really more like a rub or a paste, because our lemon chicken recipe requires no actual marinating (yay!). But basically, we coat the chicken breasts in a thick, olive oil-based herb paste flavored with oregano, thyme, garlic powder, salt and pepper. 
  2. Make the lemon chicken sauce! Stir together all of the zingy things‚Äîwhite wine, fresh garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice‚Äîto make the sauce that the chicken breasts will bake in. You‚Äôll also use this sauce to baste the chicken as it bakes, ensuring that these bright flavors have a chance to be absorbed by the chicken (without having to actually marinate the chicken). 
  3. Bake! Until you get that internal temperature reading of 165¬∞F. Then it‚Äôs time to dig in! 

## Tools You‚Äôll Need:

  * 9 x 13 baking dish (a baking sheet doesn‚Äôt work for this one, because of all of that delicious lemon chicken sauce.) 
  * Microplane grater. 
  * A citrus juicer sure comes in handy. 
  * Meat thermometer.

breast recipes, too. Here, we‚Äôll prove it:

recipe felt as miraculously breezy to you as it does to us. Let us know how it

  * ### Maggie

Can you marinate the chicken the day before?

That should be fine Maggie, hope you enjoy!

  * ### Liz Humphreys

Would you serve this with pasta?

You definitely could! It would go well with our Linguine with Lemon Garlic
Sauce. Hope you enjoy Liz!

  * ### Diana Barbieri

Do you cover chicken with foil to bake??

No need to cover Diana, hope you enjoy!

  * ### Debbie F Dyer

Can you use chicken thighs drumsticks and a chicken breast bone on?

Hi Debbie, you certainly can it will just change the cook time. Make sure the
chicken is fully cooked through before taking it out of the oven. Hope you
enjoy!

  * ### Meg

Can you use bone in chicken breasts?

Hi Meg, you can definitely try that but it will be a longer cook time. We
recommend using a skinless chicken either way. You will probably need to add
10-15 minutes of cook time. Hope you enjoy!

We made this chicken to serve on a tossed salad with a balsamic dressing and
blueberries ‚Ä¶ it was AWESOME!!!!! Made a formerly boring salad into one of the
BEST salads I have ever had!!!! We will definitely be making this again! Thank
you for sharing the recipe with us!

Thanks Carol! So happy you loved it!

  * ### Val Nicholson

Loved it! I used Chardonnay as that was what I had on hand and used a brown
sugar substitute and it turned out amazing. Very moist and flavorful.

Thanks Val so happy to hear you enjoyed it!

  * ### Jack Campbell

This was surprisingly good! I put it in a cast iron pan and cooked over
charcoal with a little smoke - a definite keeper!

Thanks Jack, glad you loved it!

  * ### Angela Stephenson

I made this for my family tonight and it was a huge hit! Even for my very
picky ten year old. I like lemon pepper chicken but it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve
made very often. But after trying this recipe tonight, I definitely will make
it more often. I paired it with roasted asparagus and garlic butter pasta and
a rustic sourdough bread. My house smelled amazing while it was cooking too!
Yum! üçã

Thanks Angela, we are so happy you loved it and happy your picky ten year old
loved it!

  * ### Liz inBuffalo

This was absolutely delicious! It was so simple and paired beautifully with
crisp, roasted fingerling potatoes and asparagus. Also made spinach for the
non asparagus eater at my table, and all tasted so good together. The recipe
came together simply and easily and we have a new favorite at out table!

Thank you so much Liz! We are so happy that everyone loved it!
