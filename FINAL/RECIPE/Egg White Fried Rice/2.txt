# Billionaire Fried Rice with Egg Whites and Shredded Conpoy

This legendary fried rice is believed to be named after, and created by, a
Hong Kong billionaire who instructed his chef to prepare healthier fried rice
on the advice of his doctor. It uses less oil and salt than traditional fried
rice, and is said to have started the trend of healthy dining in Hong Kong in
the 1980s.
