# Egg White "Fried" Rice

By Leigh Peele, In  Eats & Recipes, Recipes

### **The Recipe**

This is one of my favorite recipes. I eat this all the time! A lot of people
don't think about adding egg whites to rice, but the combination is amazing.
You can add all types of veggie combos to this spice palette as well. It goes
great with snap peas, bell peppers, edamame, broccoli, etc. Try this, you will
not be disappointed.

### **Recipe Notes and Tips**

1\. You can use any type of rice you want for this recipe. White and "sushi"
rice create a great sticky and starchy texture that I enjoy. Wild rice has a
tougher texture.

2\. If you want to kick up the flavor and caloric burn, use fresh vegetables.
I only use fresh veggies with this meal and I assure you it does make a
difference. Of course, I realize not everyone has time for that. This meal was
designed for ease and simplicity, but that doesn't mean it can't be upgraded
in sophistication and flavor. You can easily change the white rice to wild
rice and swap the peas for edamame and you will have a completely different
meal.

3\. I am not carbphobic or think "white" anything is evil. White rice is
generally easier to digest and hinders less nutrient uptake than brown rice.
Glycemic changes are minimal with mixed meals. Take home point, choose your
rice for taste and how it works with _your_ digestive system.

4\. If you are vegetarian, this dish provides a lot of protein and variety in
one meal.

**Ingredients in Grams/Ounces:**  
95 g White Rice  
42 g Light ‚ÄúButter‚Äù  
18 g Garlic Cloves, Chopped  
128 g Carrots (Small Diced, Frozen)  
145 g Green Peas (Frozen)  
3 Large Egg Whites  
1 tsp Onion Powder  
1 tsp Salt  
1/2 tsp Pepper

**Ingredients in Cups/Spoons:**  
1/2 cup White Rice  
3 tbsp Light ‚ÄúButter‚Äù  
2 Garlic Cloves, Chopped  
1 cup Carrots (Small Diced, Frozen)  
1 cup Green Peas (Frozen)  
3 Large Egg Whites  
1 tsp Onion Powder  
1 tsp Salt  
1/2 tsp Pepper

**Directions:**  
1\. Prepare rice as directed on package, omitting any salt or butter. Set
aside and keep warm. Works best if rice is a tad on the soft/sticky side.  
2\. In a large skillet, melt 1/2 of the butter with minced garlic on medium
low heat. After 2 minutes, add in carrots. Cover and let cook/simmer for 5-6
minutes.  
3\. Remove cover and add the remaining butter, peas, onion powder, salt, and
pepper. Cook for 2 more minutes.  
4\. Add rice and egg whites. Keep moving and mixing the food in the skillet
until the egg is cooked. Serve warm.

Yum Yum indeed! I have a mainteance day tomorrow and this is perfect for it.
Can I add an extra egg white for a bit more protein? Can I use full egg whites
instead of butter? You must hate me, I am changing the whole recipe! I love
the idea!

You can add more egg white, but the more you add it will change the texture.
Also, you can make egg whites and mix them in, already cooked. This is great
for getting ideas rollings.

As for the butter, yes you can use yolk, it just want have as much flavor to
it. The butter with the garlic really adds the kick. If you have the calories,
you can add a little of both too.

Play around with it. No recipe is wrong, as long as it tastes good.

I have been making a similar dish using full eggs. Do you recommened not using
the yolk for a reason? It's a DELICIOUS dish and you have just given me more
ideas for flavoring it up!

Nope, nothing wrong with a yolk. It just changes the flavor profile. I love
butter. Give me butter with garlic, and I am even happy. To keep the calories
lower, I trade out the yolk for the butter. Simple as that.

Yolk is great, I just like butter better üòâ

That looks so good! Haha, I love tossing out that white rice vs. brown rice
study when people snark about the nutritional voidness of white rice. You
opened my eyes with that one. What is your opinion on normal pasta vs. whole
wheat or "alternative" pasta like spelt/kamut/corn? For people without gluten
intolerences, of course.

Quick question: whatever happened to the Desserts cookbook? I never got to
download it and always wanted to.

Leigh,

Love your blog, but you're really late to the game of eggs with rice. The
Peruvians have been doing this for hundreds of years. Look up a dish called
chaufa.

In case you aren't being sarcastic, I don't think I created eggs and rice, as
a combo. It is a knock off of Egg Fried Rice I have eaten since youth. I just
never thought to do it with egg whites only, myself.

I do something like this, but I make a thin omlette then use it like a
tortilla and wrap the veggie-rice inside it. I top it with a spicy ketchup.
It's a Japanese recipe called Omurice
