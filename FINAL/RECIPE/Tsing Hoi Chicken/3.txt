You will be awestruck by how potato wedges transform into an Oriental delicacy
using simple, everyday ingredients like ginger, garlic and tomato ketchup.  
  
  
Deep-roasted potato fingers are deftly stir-fried with zesty ingredients like
ginger, green chillies and sauces, thickened to the right consistency and
excitingly garnished with peppy spring onions, to make an irresistible
Chinese-Style Potato Vegetable. Ensure that you prepare this just before
serving, in order to enjoy the perfect texture and consistency.  
  
  
Serve these potatoes as a side dish along with Chinese soups, stir-fries and
noodles to create an authentic mini meal.
