## Name[edit]

Look up _**hoisin sauce**_ in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

The word _hoisin_ is derived from the Chinese words for "seafood" (simplified
Chinese: 海鲜; traditional Chinese: 海鮮; Cantonese Yale: _hói sīn_ ; pinyin:
_hǎixiān_ ), although the sauce does not contain any seafood ingredients and
is not commonly consumed with seafood.[1] The reason for the name is "seafood
flavour", a common adjective in Chinese cuisine, especially Sichuanese ("fish
fragrant").

## Ingredients[edit]

The key ingredient of hoisin sauce is fermented soybean paste.[2][3]

Some hoisin sauce ingredients include starches such as sweet potato, wheat and
rice, and water, sugar, soybeans, sesame seeds, white distilled vinegar, salt,
garlic, red chili peppers, and sometimes preservatives or coloring agents.
Traditionally, hoisin sauce is made using toasted mashed soybeans.

### Vietnamese cuisine[edit]

In Vietnamese, hoisin sauce is called _tương đen_. It is a popular condiment
for _phở_ , a Vietnamese noodle soup, in southern Vietnam. The sauce can be
directly added into a bowl of _phở_ at the table, or it can be used as a dip
for the meat of _phở_ dishes. In _phở_ , hoisin is typically accompanied by
Sriracha sauce or _tương đỏ_. The hoisin sauce is also used to make a dipping
sauce for Vietnamese _gỏi cuốn_ (often translated as 'spring roll') and other
similar dishes. In cooking, it can be used for glazing broiled chicken.
