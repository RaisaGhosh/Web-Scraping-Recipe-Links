The name of this recipe has its roots in a wonderful old culinary term that
refers to dishes cooked with fiery hot spices and condiemtns that may have
been akin to the heat of hell! The blending of mustard and curry powder with a
plentiful amount of butter makes a piquant yet tasty crust on a roast of lamb,
ideal served hot or cold. And for those who enjoy mutton, this devilled mix is
an ideal partner for the stronger-tasting meat.
