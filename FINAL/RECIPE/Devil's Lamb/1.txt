## Steps

  * Preheat one oven to 100C on steam setting. Preheat a second oven to 140C, and a third to 180C. Heat fryer to 180C.
  * To make the lamb skewer, mix salt and spices together.
  * Trim excess fat and bone off lamb belly and cut in half.
  * Dust a small amount of the meat glue on one side of the belly and place the other half on top. Sprinkle spice mix onto lamb belly and place into a large vaccum seal bag. Seal bag, removing as much air as possible. Steam in oven at 100C for 2 hours.
  * Once cooked, lightly press belly between two trays and chill in blast chiller until cool.
  * Cut into 3.5cm x 2cm pieces and keep aside until needed to thread onto skewer.
  * Meanwhile to make the leaks, cut into 20cm lengths and clean thoroughly in cold water to remove all dirt.
  * Vaccum pack leeks in vaccum bag, with buerre noisette, thyme and salt and pepper, removing as much air as possible. Steam bags in oven for 15 minutes, remove from oven and place into iced water. Once cool, remove from bag and set aside.
  * Place feta into a thermomix and blend on speed 6 until smooth and set aside.
  * Cut the chicken breast into rough 4cm pieces and place into thermomix with the egg whites. Blend on speed 6 until the mousse is smooth. Add cream and mix to incorporate the cream, careful not to over mix to prevent splitting. Once smooth, pass through a fine drum sieve using a plastic scraper into a stainless steel bowl. Chill over ice bath.
  * Fold in the feta, chives, espelette pepper and lemon zest through the mousse and place into a piping bag with 2cm nozzle. To test seasoning, cook a teaspoon amount wrapped in cling film in boiling water.
  * Cut leeks into 10cm long pieces and then cut lengthways to the centre only and unroll the leeks keeping the outside 2 layers.
  * Separate the 2 outside layers of the leek, keeping the best shaped pieces and lay out 10 of the best pieces.
  * Bring oven down to 90C on steam setting.
  * Pipe chicken mousse down centre of each leak sheet and roll up so that on the outside looks like a leek. (A little excess mousse from sides is ok as it can be trimmed later).
  * Roll ‘leek’ in cling film tightly, tie the ends to ensure the roll is quite firm, the roll should be 1.5cm thick.
  * Cook the ‘leeks’ in the steamer on a steam tray for 4 minutes then place in iced water. Once chilled, trim ends whilst still in cling film and then unroll remaining cling film and set aside for service.
  * To reheat for service, place ‘leeks’ in a little clarified beurre noisette and gently warm on a low to medium heat until warmed through.
  * Meanwhile to make the fondants, mix sugar and shallot juice in a small saucepan on medium heat, and simmer for 4 minutes. Let cool and set aside for later.
  * Cut the length side off the potato so that it will lay flat. Cut a round puck using a 4.5cm cutter. While potato is still in cutter, cut top and bottom off so the cutter is flush with the top and bottom of potato.
  * Remove from cutter and bevel edges of potato with a peeler.
  * Repeat process and set aside in cold water.
  * To cook potatoes, remove from water and dry with chux. Place potatoes into a cold stainless steel pan then turn on medium heat, adding butter and garlic. Cook potatoes without moving them around or turning to allow them to colour and loosen from the pan.
  * Once a nice even colour has been achieved turn over, add half of the shallot juice and cook until potatoes are tender through the centre, about 10 minutes.
  * Once cooked, remove fondants from the pots and place into a gastro tray. Strain shallot jus over the top. Hold until required for service.
  * To serve fondants, take required number and a little jus and simmer until jus forms a glaze. Serve immediately, or hold in salamander for a maximum of 2 minutes whilst plating other components on plate.
  * Meanwhile, to make the sheftalia place all ingredients except the caul fat into a stand up mixer fitted with paddle attachment and mix until all ingredients are well incorportated and slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.
  * Shape into 10 even small sized pieces and chill in fridge for 10 minutes.
  * Remove caul fat from water and squeeze excess water out.
  * Roll meat in caul fat to cover, trimming off any excess caul fat.
  * Once all are wrapped, place in a tray and cover with cling film until needed to thread onto skewer.
  * Meanwhile to make the onion sous bise, bake onions on a bed of rock salt at 180C for 30 minutes. Once cooked, remove from oven and let onions cool slightly.
  * Once cooled, remove skins and place into a pan with butter, sugar and vinegar. Simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from heat and set aside to cool for 15 minutes.
  * Once cooled, blend onions in thermomix until smooth, season and pass through a fine sieve. Set aside until service.
  * Meanwhile to make the braised onions, peel all onions to an even size and place into a gastro tray. Add the butter, garlic, thyme and salt to the tray and cover well with foil. Place into the oven and cook for 50 minutes.
  * Remove tray from oven and remove foil, place back into oven and increase temperature to 160C and cook for 1 hour, turning the onions every 15 minutes to ensure even colouring.
  * Once cooked, remove from oven and let onions cool in butter to room temperature.
  * To finish, remove onions from pan, reserving juices. Discard the outer layers of onions and cut ¼ off the top of the onion to reveal the inner rings. Set aside in a ½ sized gastro tray.
  * Strain juices from original baking tray into a medium sized pot and add lamb jus. Bring to the boil, remove from heat and pour over the cooked onions. Set aside until required.
  * To serve, take required amount of onions and a little of the jus and gently reheat in a saucepan, glazing the onions.
  * Meanwhile, to make the straight onion ring, preheat chargrill.
  * Clean spring onions thoroughly to ensure all dirt is removed from roots. Cut into 15cm lengths, keeping roots on.
  * Place spring onions onto chargrill and char quickly, set aside.
  * Mix the flours together in a large bowl. Set aside a little of the mixture in a separate bowl for dusting. Add soda water to large bowl and mix until just combined, set aside in fridge until required.
  * To finish, add ice to batter mix. Dust spring onions in reserved flour mixture then dip into batter, ensuring not to cover roots with batter. Place into fryer and cook until light golden brown, season and serve immediately.
  * Meanwhile to make the pickled shallot, place all ingredients into a saucepan and cook on low heat with lid on for 15 minutes.
  * Remove lid and simmer until liquid has reduced to a nice glaze over the shallots. Set aside at room temperature until required.
  * Meanwhile, to make the sweetbreads, place sweetbreads in a saucepan and cover with clean cold water.
  * Bring water to the boil, remove sweetbreads and refresh in iced water.
  * Once chilled, remove sweetbreads from iced water and dry on paper towel. Pull sweetbreads apart into 10c piece sized pieces and remove any of the white membrane. Hold until required.
  * To cook the skewer to order, finish off required number of sheftalia in lamb jus, colour well in pan ensuring caul fat is rendered as much as possible. While cooking, add lamb belly pieces (2 per person) into the lamb jus to warm.
  * In a separate pan, heat 1tbsp vegetable oil and add sweetbreads to colour. Add a small amount of butter to finish off and cook for a further 1 minute. Remove from pan and drain well on paper towel.
  * Skewer the belly, then sheftalia, then sweetbread and close with another piece of belly. To serve, place on mini grill.
