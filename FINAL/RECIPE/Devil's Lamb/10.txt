## Devil’s Curry

{{totalReview}}

A culinary tradition of the Portuguese Eurasian community in Malacca, Malaysia
and Singapore, this spicy and tangy chicken dish is also commonly known as
Kari Ayam Debal, or Curry Debal in Kristang or Curry Devil. In the old days.
it’s usually prepared with meat leftovers from the Christmas feast. Almost
every family have their own favorite way of preparing this dish. In mine,
there’s a touch of yellow mustard sauce on top the usual vinegar and hot
spices. Give it a try!
