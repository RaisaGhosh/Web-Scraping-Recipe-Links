fabulous hot sauce of Chinese or Vietnamese origin. Chilli Garlic Sauce is
made to spice-up your taste buds and make your chilli garlic noodles more
enjoyable. The principal ingredients are chili, garlic, and vinegar.  
  
Chilli Garlic Sauce is sold and is available readily available in the Indian

Capsicum - better atleast 1/3 cup or can even go upto 1/2 cup if there are no
kids who hate vegetables. While using 1/4 chilli garlic paste, be careful as
red chilli powder spiciness varies a lot. I just used about 1 - 1.5 teaspoon
chilli garlic paste as I used extra spicy chilli powder to make it.
