_**  Chilli garlic noodles is a quick and delicious Indo-Chinese dish, that is
ready under 15 minutes. Add protein of choice to make it a wholesome meal.**_

I'm sure by now you know I love **Indo Chinese** cuisine, given by the number
of dishes I have shared! Also if you have been following my post, you guys
know how I love quick fix meals! This **spicy** **chilli garlic noodles
recipe** is just that! If your palette is craving for some spicy food then
these noodles are the right deal for the job!

These noodles are loaded with garlic and a lot of heat from a combination of
the fresh Thai bird's eye chilli and the dry red chillies. The Thai chillies
are from my very own little herb garden, and these little guys are reaaallly
spicy! I used just 2 and that was enough heat as the chili garlic sauce is
pretty spicy as well. This is such a fuss-free and quick meal, just yet
another perfect one to dish out on those busy weeknights! Enjoy!!
