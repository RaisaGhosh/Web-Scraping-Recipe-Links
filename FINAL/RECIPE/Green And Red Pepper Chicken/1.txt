**In these warmer months, with fresh produce hitting gardens and store shelves
in more abundance, I love cooking with fresh ingredients. This bell pepper
chicken recipe uses fresh peppers, tomatoes,** and lots of fresh herbs.
Perfect for a garden-fresh **dinner!**

I love light and fresh-tasting meals in the summer. Something that reminds me
that a tasty dinner is as easy as picking some fresh herbs from my garden, or
a lively bunch of greens from the produce section shelves. This recipe is a
perfect case in point.

## For The Love Of Red Vegetables

Red veggies are so good for us! And the good news is, most of them have a
terrific flavor that nearly everyone enjoys. That's great news for the folks
at your dinner table!

> Many red fruits and veggies are loaded with powerful, healthy antioxidants
> -- such as lycopene and anthocyanins -- that may do everything from fight
> heart disease and prostate cancer to decrease the risk for stroke and
> macular degeneration (the leading cause of blindness in people aged 60 and
> older). Antioxidants soak up damaging free radicals.

## Chicken With Bell Peppers

Chicken and bell peppers just go together. And the good news, you can really
use any color pepper you prefer. They don't have to be red.

Most folks prefer red peppers because they are sweeter.

Green bell peppers are bitter simply because they are red bell peppers that
haven't matured. They are picked early before they ripen, so their flavors are
also on the less developed side which makes them a little more bitter. This
can be a good thing in many dishes, however.

In fact, all bell peppers are the same pepper, just at different stages of
ripeness. These different stages have slightly different flavors and nutrition
profiles. But all of them lend themselves to making a tasty meal.

## How To Use Up Your Extra Bell Peppers

Have extra peppers from the store or your garden? Here are some tasty ways to
use them up quickly!

### Bell Pepper Chicken Ingredients

**2Â¼  cups chopped red bell pepper** - As mentioned above, you can use any
color pepper here. Pick your favorite!

**1  cup chopped purple onion** - Yellow onion will work in a pinch, but
purple is the better option.

****2 tbsp. oil****  â€“ I used coconut oil, but you can use olive oil or
whatever oil you typically cook with.

**1 â…“  lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts**  - Cut these into small, bite-
sized pieces. The smaller they are, the faster they will cook. In a pinch,
chicken thighs work just as well.

**2  tsp. garlic powder** - You can also use garlic granules or even fresh,
minced, garlic cloves. If using fresh garlic, use 6 medium cloves and mince
them as fine as you can get them. You can even mash them into paste if that's
easier.

**Â½  cup fresh, chopped flat-leaf** parsley - This is also known as Italian
parsley. You can use curly parsley if that's all you have, but flat-leaf
parsley gives the best flavors in this dish.

**1  cup chopped fresh basil** - Chop this somewhat coarsely. It doesn't have
to be super fine. You could potentially use dried basil, but it won't have the
same effect. If using dry herbs, start with 1 to 2 tbsp. and adjust up only if
needed.

**1  cup fresh, chopped tomatoes** - This can be any variety of tomatoes that
you prefer.

**Â½  tsp. ground black pepper** - White pepper could work well here too if
that's what you have.

**Â½  tsp. salt **- I used pink Himalayan salt, but use what you have on hand.
This measurement is just a suggestion. Add as much or as little as you like.

## How To Make Bell Pepper Chicken

Heat the oil in a large pan.

SautÃ© the bell peppers and onions at medium-high heat until soft.

Add the chicken and remaining garlic powder, and cook completely
(approximately 15 minutes, depending on the size of your chicken chunks).

Turn off the heat, stir in the tomatoes and fresh herbs.

Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.

## How To Store Bell Pepper Chicken

This will keep in the fridge for up to three days. It packs well and travels
well as long as you keep it cool.

## Can You Freeze Bell Pepper Chicken?

Yes, butâ€¦

Freeze it before adding the fresh herbs and tomatoes. You can stir those in at
the last minutes before serving if you warm this up in a skillet after
thawing.

To thaw, place in the fridge overnight or up to a full 24 hours before you
want to eat it.

## Need To Round Out The Meal?

This is great tossed with pasta or served on a bed of rice.

This looks really good, but is it a little dry? Does it need any liquid added
(broth, wine, water)?

Job - I didn't need any. But you can certainly add something if you prefer.

What, no beets? That was my first reaction when I saw the name of the dish.
With beets it all turns red, or pink! I have been getting beets from my CSA
and have never cooked them before, because I never grew them. When we stop
traveling and I have a garden again I will be growing them because Hubby likes
everything to turn red! Anything to get him to eat vegetables is good in my
book.

Mary - I have have a couple beet recipes here, but I'm not really a fan. So
unfortunately, you won't find many beet recipes here. I keep trying to like
them, butâ€¦
