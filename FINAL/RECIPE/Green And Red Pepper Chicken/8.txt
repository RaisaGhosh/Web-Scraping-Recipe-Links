# Garlic Red Pepper Chicken

June 01, 2021 by Dale Gray in DINNER, CHICKEN, HEALTHY, KETO

This recipe is brought to you in partnership with Spice Tribe \- They are a
small-batch spice company that works to benefit farmers and their families
directly through fair trade. There is no fresher than this, and their belief
in home cooking for health and community really resonates with me. They have
everything you need for this recipe in their online store, including salt and
pepper.

My garlic red pepper chicken recipe is inspired by the ingredients I had on
hand and my mother’s ability to use spices as a way to keep things interesting
and filling. Please know that the recipe is completely customizable to
whichever ingredients you have on hand. A few ideas include: Using cauliflower
or potatoes instead of chicken. Adding kale, spinach or collards for color and
texture plus extra nutrition. This garlic red pepper chicken is delicious when
served on a baked sweet potato stuffed with kale and caramelized onions. We’ve
had it with crusty bread and butter, we’ve served it over rice or buttered
noodles, we’ve eaten it cold right out of the tupperware the next day. Lately
I feel there are no rules because the only rule that matters is social
distancing. I hope that you are happy in your homes, that you are cooking more
and spending valuable time with those you love. If you decide to try this
recipe, please let me know how it went by tagging me @thedaleyplate on

Some notes:

-If you’re unable to use sherry, use more chicken stock.  
-Add vegetables of your choice. For vegetables that cook longer, add them with the stock and sherry. Tender greens can be added during the last 5 minutes of cooking.

 **Garlic Red Pepper Chicken**  
 **Prep Time:** 10 minutes (up to 8 hours to marinate) **| Cook Time:** 30
minutes **| Serves:** 4

Ingredients:

1lb boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 -inch pieces  
1 tablespoon good quality smoked Spanish paprika, like Spice Tribe Pimenton de
la Vera  
1 tablespoon garlic powder  
1 teaspoon kosher salt  
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  
(Optional: 1/2 teaspoon cumin powder)

1 tablespoon olive oil  
1 cup chopped yellow onion  
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper  
4 cloves garlic, finely minced  
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes  
1 teaspoon tomato paste  
2 stems fresh herbs like thyme or oregano  
1/2 cup sherry  
1/2 cup chicken stock  
1 bay leaf  
1-2 tablespoons red wine vinegar OR lemon juice  
Optional: 1/4 cup heavy cream

Method:

Place chicken in a bowl and season with paprika, garlic powder, salt, pepper
and optional cumin. Toss to ensure that chicken is fully coated, cover and
refrigerate for one hour or preferably overnight.

Add olive oil to a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper (a jar of
drained pimento peppers would be a speedy pantry solution) and sauté for 10
minutes until tender, stirring until the onions are light golden brown and
fragrant. This step breaks down the onions and it’s important because it forms
part of the sauce.

Add garlic and chicken, stir and cook until chicken is no longer pale (2-3
minutes). Lastly, add red pepper flakes, tomato paste, herbs, bay leaf, sherry
and chicken stock. Simmer over medium heat with the lid halfway on for 15-20
minutes until chicken is tender, longer if you prefer your sauce more reduced.

Stir in vinegar or lemon juice right before removing from heat then add
optional heavy cream, season to taste with salt and pepper and scatter with
fresh herbs.
