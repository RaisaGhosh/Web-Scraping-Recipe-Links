 _(Inside: I went to a new restaurant in town and was reminded how much I love
soup. So I made this   Simple Seafood Ramen Soup that's to DIE for.)_

My husband and I were out running errands, without the kids (woohoo!), and
decided to hit-up a new restaurant in town.

The food was insanely good. But the prices-ouch.

So, when I got home and wanted even more of their way-too-expensive-for-
little-ole-me ramen, I pulled out some ingredients and made this amazingly
fantastic Simple Seafood Ramen Soup.

Now, you can use those cute packets of ramen noodles that you get at the
store, but because I was feeling fancy, I decided to use udon noodles for my
Simple Seafood Ramen Soup. They're a little thicker and have a different
texture, but it's fun to mix it up sometimes…

But something you do NOT want to mix-up is the fish sauce.

No…wait, before you close out and run off-I'm serious.

The flavor and "pow" you want in this dish comes from Fish Sauce.

So, don't give up on me. Just getcha some.

And, don't forget, even if you don't have your fish sauce at the ready, go
ahead and pin this Simple Seafood Ramen Soup-that way you can find it again
when you do have it.

Now, ready-set-GO Ramen!
