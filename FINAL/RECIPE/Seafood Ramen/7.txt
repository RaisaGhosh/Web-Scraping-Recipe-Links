"This is the perfect dish to feel comforted and cosy on those cold winter
nights as it feels like a big warm hug in a bowl! There is a beautiful mix of
flavours from the spicy sambal chili paste, rich buttery miso and salty brine
from the pipi’s. This dish was created with Goolwa Pipi Co Ready to Serve
Pipi’s that can be found in Australia."

## Broth

### Method

  * #### Step 1

In a large pot on a low heat, combine the shallot, olive oil and sesame oil
and fry for 2 minutes once the pan starts sizzling. Stir occasionally to
ensure the shallot does not burn.

  * #### Step 2

On the same heat and in the same pot, add your ginger, miso paste, butter and
sambal chili paste and fry for a further 2 minutes until a deep red and rich
aromatic paste forms. Stir the paste occasionally to ensure it does not burn.
Add the chicken stock, pipi juices and fish sauce to the pot and bring to the
boil. Once your broth is boiling turn the heat right down and leave to simmer
for 20 minutes with the lid on.

## Soup

### Method

  * #### Step 1

While your broth is cooking prepare the ingredients for the soup. Finely dice
the spring onions to your liking.

  * #### Step 2

In a small pot, boil your eggs for 7 minutes then immediately place into an
ice bath for several minutes. Peel away the shell, cut in half and set to the
side.

  * #### Step 3

In a medium sized pot, cook your soba noodles in heavily salted boiling hot
water for 4 minutes. Drain the noodles and place into individual bowls for
when serving.

  * #### Step 4

Place your eggs, seaweed, a sprinkling of spring onions, sesame seeds and
chili flakes and the pipis onto the noodles. Pour the piping hot broth all
over. You will see the pipi shells begin to open. Serve immediately and enjoy!
