# Honey Chicken Recipe

Jump to Recipe*Print Recipe

**A very simple Asian style sweet and spicy honey chicken recipe. A very easy
recipe that can be put together in twenty minutes. Recipe with step by step
pictures.**

This is Vinodh's cousin Ashwin's recipe. This is a very bachelor friendly
recipe and has very few ingredients. He gave me this recipe a long time back
but I just could not get it done for the camera. Whenever I make this at home,
my son kind of advertises to whoever is at home that this fabulous recipe is
from his brother. Ashwin anna this, Ashwin anna that……. Ashwin is his favorite
cousin. This recipe packs a punch. I like to serve it with fried rice. He is
leaving to New Zealand on Monday and I wanted to publish it before he left. So
here is the epic honey chicken recipe and bon voyage to the most adorable guy
in the family!

Cube the chicken breast and add it to a bowl. Add in the ginger-garlic paste,
salt, soy sauce and the red chilli flakes. Soy sauce is salty. So go easy on
the salt. We can adjust the seasoning later. If you want a spicy chicken, add
more red chilli flakes. Mix everything well. Marinate the chicken for thirty
minutes. I marinated the chicken at room temperature. If you are going to
marinate for a long time, stash it in the refrigerator.  

Heat oil in a pan and add in the green chillies and the white part (oniony
part) of the spring onions. Saute for a minute. Add in the marinated chicken
along with the juices to the pan. I prefer doing the dish in a wide pan, so
the chicken cooks evenly.  

Do not add any water. The moisture from the chicken is enough. Saute for about
5-6 minutes until the chicken is cooked and relatively dry. Once the chicken
is cooked and dry, add in the honey. Saute for a minute.  

Make a corn starch slurry by adding a tablespoon of cornstarch to half a cup
of water. Add it to the chicken.  

The corn starch slurry will immediately thicken up and form a velvety sauce.
If the sauce is very thick, add little water to adjust the consistency. Simmer
the honey chicken for a minute.  

Remove from heat and garnish the honey chicken with toasted sesame seeds and
spring onions.  

Serve honey chicken with fried rice.  
Here are some fried rice recipes that will go perfectly well with honey
chicken.

Egg Fried Rice  
Vegetable Fried Rice  
Burnt-Garlic Fried Rice  
Capsicum Fried Rice
