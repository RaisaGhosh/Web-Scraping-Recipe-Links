each side with salt and pepper.

2.

Place flour in a shallow dish. Coat chicken in flour and shake off excess.

3.

Melt most of the butter in a large skillet over high heat – hold back about 1
tsp for later.

4.

Place chicken in skillet and cook for 2 – 3 minutes until golden. Turn and
cook the other side for 1 minute.

5.

Turn heat down slightly to medium high.

6.

Make a bit of room in the pan and add garlic and top with remaining dab of
butter. Stir garlic briefly once butter melts.

7.

Add vinegar, soy sauce and honey. Stir / shake pan to combine. Bring sauce to
simmer, then simmer for 1 minute or until slightly thickened.

8.

Turn chicken to coat in sauce. If the sauce gets too thick, add a touch of
water and stir.

9.

Remove from stove immediately. Place chicken on plates and drizzle over
remaining sauce.
