 **Sweet and sticky Teriyaki Chicken in homemade Teriyaki sauce is the perfect
easy dinner recipe served with rice and a simple cucumber salad.**

I love this easy Teriyaki chicken recipe for those nights when I don't have
much time to get something on the table for dinner. The chicken takes minutes
to make because I cut out the marinating and simply cook the chicken with the
sauce. Of course a good marinade has its place but when you need dinner on the
table fast, this recipe has got your back.

The sweet and sticky chicken is perfect served with steamed rice and a
vegetable side dish of your choice. Here, I served it with a simple cucumber
salad but steamed broccoli or sugar snap peas will be just as delicious.

## Ingredients

_**Full recipe with amounts can be found in the recipe card below.**_

  * **Chicken breasts.** Boneless skinless chicken breasts. You can use boneless chicken thighs too.
  * **Sesame oil.**
  * **Soy sauce.** Coconut aminos or Tamari can be substituted. Low sodium soy sauce is also a good option.
  * **Rice vinegar.**
  * **Sake/Mirin.** (optional)
  * **Fresh Garlic.**
  * **Fresh Ginger.**
  * **Honey.**
  * **Brown sugar.**

## How to make easy Teriyaki chicken

  1. **Cook the chicken:** Because I cut out the marinating of the chicken, it's important to cook the chicken in a hot pan quickly to avoid it overcooking. Chop boneless, skinless chicken breasts into bite-sized chunks then pat dry with paper towels. This will allow the chicken to brown quicker. Preheat a large skillet or frying pan over high heat then cook the chicken in a teaspoon of sesame oil until golden brown all over. Remove from the pan while you make the sauce.
  2. **Make the sauce:** Combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sake/mirin (if using), garlic, ginger, honey and brown sugar in a bowl and whisk well then pour into the hot pan. Allow to come to a boil and cook for a minute or two until the sauce starts to reduce. Stir regularly to prevent the sauce from burning.
  3. **Combine with the chicken:** Add the chicken and all their resting juices back into the pan. Stir the chicken with the sauce and cook for another 4-5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened. Reducing the sauce will allow it to thicken but if you want to thicken it even more, add a slurry of cornstarch and water to the pan and cook until thickened. Taste and adjust seasoning by adding more soy sauce if necessary. Serve the Teriyaki chicken with rice and garnish with sesame seeds and sliced spring or green onions.

## Can I make this ahead?

Teriyaki chicken can be made and stored in an airtight container in the fridge
for up to 3 days. Leftovers can be stored exactly the same way. Reheat in a
hot pan with a splash of water to loosen the sauce.

## What to serve with Teriyaki chicken

  1. **Cucumber salad**
  2. Steamed rice
  3. Steamed broccoli or sugar snap peas. Any vegetables will be delicious alongside though.

## Easy chicken breast recipes

  1. **Crispy Chicken Schnitzel**
  2. **Creamy spinach garlic chicken**
  3. **Easy lemon-herb chicken skewers**
  4. **Caprese stuffed chicken breasts**
