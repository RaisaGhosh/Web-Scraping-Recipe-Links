Jump to Recipe Print Recipe

## Teriyaki Chicken is a super easy chicken recipe cooked in 10-minutes with
no marinading!

Crispy skinless chicken thighs stir-fried and swimming in a beautiful
flavoured homemade teriyaki sauce. A hint of garlic adds a twist on a
traditional Japanese Teriyaki Chicken recipe and makes it absolutely
addictive! This is better than ANY store-bought teriyaki sauce, guaranteed.

Why get Japanese take out when you can make a deliciously _close to_ authentic
Teriyaki Chicken right at home!

There is no need to de-bone chicken thighs, or worry about rendering fat from
skin. This Teriyaki Chicken Recipe is Fast. Simple. Delicious.

It's no secret that this is my favourite sauce, right? Through the years you
can find The Best Teriyaki Beef Meatballs, Teriyaki SALMON, and my favourite →
Simple Chicken Teriyaki Stir Fry.

One thing I found is that I haven't actually given you a simple and easy
Teriyaki Chicken Recipe for those hectic days in the week where dinner is no
where in sight, but CAN be in no time at all. No wonder Teriyaki chicken is
one of the most popular chicken recipes in the world!

### How to make Teriyaki Chicken

This recipe will be loved by your entire family, using minimal ingredients you
already have in your pantry or refrigerator!

  * Soy sauce (use a light soy to reduce the sodium content)
  * Sugar (white is the preferred sugar used in a traditional Teriyaki sauce, however I prefer using brown sugar)
  * Sake (or a rice wine vinegar if you have it, but any white vinegar will work)
  * Mirin (This is an optional ingredient because I understand not many readers have it or can find it. If you want to get yourself a bottle, any Asian or Japanese store will stock it. Otherwise, you can always order it online. Or just skip it all together!
  * Garlic (because…well, garlic) -- you can substitute garlic for ginger if you prefer!

Please use chicken thighs for this. Breasts do work well, BUT chicken thighs
stay extra juicy and are perfect for Teriyaki.

When searing your chicken, make sure the oil in your pan is hot before adding
the meat to get a really nice golden sear. Use a large pan to avoid over-
crowding and simmering your chicken in their own juices. You want them to fry!
The pans I tend to use are 12-inches (30 cm) or over.

### Sake and Mirin

Both are Japanese alcoholic beverages, although Mirin is generally only used
in cooking. Mirin is stronger and sweeter than sake. If you can't find Mirin,
Sake can be used as a substitute with a pinch of sugar.

If you cannot get a hold of Sake, you can use sherry, any white vinegar, apple
cider vinegar, Chinese shiaoxing wine, Vermouth or dry white wine.

You can also leave them out all together, but they do add a hint of acidity to
balance out the sweetness of the sugar, plus a really nice subtle tang to the
Teriyaki sauce.

### What to serve with Teriyaki Chicken

Steamed broccoli and rice are the BEST sides (white, jasmine, brown or even
wild rice work really well). Or try it with our Fried Rice recipe! Drizzle all
of the extra sauce over everything in your bowl for ultimate flavour.

You can also top your chicken with sesame seeds and/or sliced green onion and
enjoy a Teriyaki Chicken Bowl in the comfort of your own home!

bottled sauce!

Prep: 5 mins

Cook: 10 mins

Total: 15 mins

Serves: 4 serves

### Ingredients

  * 1.3 pounds (600 grams) skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
  * 1 tablespoon cooking oil
  * 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
  * 3 tablespoons light brown sugar (or white granulated sugar)
  * 3 tablespoons cooking Sake ((rice wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar)
  * 2 tablespoons Mirin (optional -- white wine or dry sherry can be substituted)
  * 1 tablespoon sesame oil, optional (adds a wonderful flavour)
  * 2 teaspoons minced garlic (2 cloves garlic)*
  * 1 shallot/green onion stem, sliced to garnish
  * 4 cups broccoli florets, lightly steamed
  * 1 teaspoon cornstarch (or corn flour) mixed with 2 teaspoons water (ONLY IF NEEDED)

### Instructions

  * Heat cooking oil in a large pan over medium heat. Stir fry chicken, stirring occasionally until lightly browned and crisp.

  * In a small jug or bowl whisk together the soy sauce, sugar, Sake/vinegar, Mirin and sesame oil to combine. Set aside.

  * Add the garlic to the centre of the pan and saute until lightly fragrant (about 30 seconds). Pour in the sauce and allow to cook, while stirring, until the sauce thickens into a beautiful shiny glaze (about 2-3 minutes).*

  * Add in the steamed broccoli. Garnish with green onion (or shallot) slices and serve over steamed rice.

### Notes

  * Replace garlic for 1/2 teaspoon minced ginger. You can also use both if you wish.
  * If for some reason your sauce has not thickened, quickly whisk in the cornstarch/water mixture and continue stirring until syrupy.
  * Alternatively, if sauce is too thick, add water in tablespoon increments until reaching your desired thickness.

Made this Tonight for the second time . I followed the recipe exactly! It’s
been a big hit with my 4 grandkids who never want anything but pizza! I always
triple the sauce and cook a lot of chicken. Can chicken breasts be used also?
That sauce recipe is amazing. Will make again in a few weeks. Also made the
Mongolian Beef. It’s to die for!

This turned out delicious! I doubled the recipe and added honey instead of
doubling brown sugar. I also had to add cornstarch because it was too thin but
that fixed it! So good!

Excellent! My kids do not like teriyaki at restaurants but they will eat this
any day of the week. I like how it is a one pot meal that includes the
veggies. Easy to make and packed with flavor. I will never buy jarred sauce
again! I am so glad my Google search led me to this site as I already have a
list of other recipes I can't wait to try!

This sauce was extremely flavorful and so much better than the bottled stuff!
I am always nervous about chicken thighs because I am typically a white/breast
meat only person. I went with them and they did not disappoint! I sautéed some
onions, zucchini and red peppers and added them at the same time as the
broccoli. I did have to use cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. I also used
some chopped green onions as suggest along with sesame seeds for garnish. I
used rice vinegar, brown sugar and sherry in the sauce. Very glad to have
found this recipe - a definite keeper and adding extra veggies worked great!
Thank you so much ?

This is so easy and so delicious! I substituted coconut aminos and monk fruit
to make it low carb and it turned out fantastic. The sauce was perfect and the
thickness was just right. Next time I will make extra sauce to put on veggies.
Definitely a keeper.

My husband has been BEGGING for me to make teriyaki chicken, so when he woke
up (he works night shift, so he eats dinner with us before leaving for work)
he was so excited, and devoured it… and told me this recipe is a keeper. I

in a separate pan. Then add the chicken and sauce in to everything.

This is so complicated! I put the ingredients together and all that but then i
put the damned teriyaki chicken in the pan and it exploded on fire and burned
my eyebrows off and set my whole cooktop on fire. In a panic I frizbeed the
pan out the door into the backyard as i hurried to get the fire extinguisher
and put out the inferno. But alas the flames were erupting again and again and
i almost passed out from lack of oxygen. In a greater panic i poured water on
the cooktop to cool it down but then a massive fireball the shape of a nuclear
mushroom cloud moved up the wall and crawled across the ceiling which set fire
to my knick knacks hung around the kitchen. Since the kitchen was covered in
burning water i decided to spray the walls with water to put out all the spot
fires and eventually i got it all under control.

On the bright side the house smells like teriyaki and the insurance company
granted a fire and water damage claim so I'm getting a new kitchen. The dog
ate the teriyaki in the backyard and judging by the lack of sauce left on the
pan, the dog loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this tonight after reading the reviews and looking at your awesome

garlic). Delicious!! So fresh and flavorful -- way better than a store-bought
sauce. My boys and my husband loved it. I used chicken breasts but I think
next time I will use thighs like you recommended; i feel like the breasts came
out a little dry and firm, even though they tasted delicious in the sauce. I
can also see using this sauce as a marinade for other dishes! Thank you so
much for sharing your wonderful recipe!!

OMG!!! This was sooo delicious!!! So quick and easy to make. Will use this
recipe more often. My sauce thickened perfectly without needing corn starch.
Tip for others to make it thick: turn the heat up high so it looks like the
sauce is boiling. Keep stirring and wait for it to thicken. When t starts
thickening turn the heat low. That’s how I managed to thicken sauces
everytime. Hope this helps 🙂
