 _Homemade Ginger Ale comes together in no time with just four simple
ingredients: fresh ginger, sugar, lime juice, and club soda. It 's incredibly
refreshing! You'll never want to buy ginger ale from the store again after you
try this version._

I've never been a huge fan of soda, but ginger ale is an exception. I don't
drink it often, but every now and then I crave it. It's a refreshing treat,
and homemade ginger ale is no different!

In fact, I think this version is even more refreshing than the store versions,
most likely due to the simple ingredients.

## How to Make homemade ginger ale

  1. Water is gently simmered with chopped, fresh ginger to create an infusion.
  2. The ginger water is then heated with sugar to create a ginger syrup.
  3. You mix the syrup with club soda and freshly squeezed lime juice.

That's it! The total recipe time is 2 hours, but it's almost entirely
inactive. Letting the infusion steep and the syrup chill, etc.

## Recipe Notes

  * If you've never peeled ginger before, I find that it's easier to use a spoon instead of a vegetable peeler, especially if the ginger is oddly shaped. This tutorial from Bon Appetit shows you how.
  * I don't own a SodaStream, but based on other recipes I've seen, this recipe should work fine with your machine.
  * The one trick with this recipe is finding the proper balance of fizziness when mixing the ingredients at the end, since you're diluting some of the club soda with a non-carbonated syrup and lime juice. Using a soda machine would help eliminate this issue.
  * If you want to experiment, there's another type of homemade ginger ale that's fermented, similar to kombucha. It takes a bit more work, and I haven't tried it myself, but I thought it was worth mentioning!

### Ingredients

US Customary \- Metric

#### For the Ginger Syrup

  * ▢ 2 cups water
  * ▢ 1 cup chopped, peeled ginger 
  * ▢ 1/2 cup granulated sugar
  * ▢ Pinch of salt

#### For the Ginger Ale

  * ▢ Ginger syrup
  * ▢ 1 quart club soda or seltzer water (approximately)
  * ▢ 2-3 medium limes, juiced (approximately)

### Instructions

  * ▢

In a medium-sized saucepan, bring the water and ginger to a simmer over medium
heat, then reduce to low heat. Loosely cover the pan so steam can vent from
one of the sides. Gently simmer for 40 minutes. The liquid should be barely
bubbling; you don’t want the water to reduce. The point is to infuse the
ginger flavor into the water.

  * ▢

Remove from heat and let steep, covered, for 20 minutes, then strain the
liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Discard the ginger.

  * ▢

Return the ginger-infused water to the saucepan, adding the sugar and a pinch
of salt, then place over medium heat, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved,
approximately 5 minutes. Chill syrup in a covered jar until cold, around 2
hours (you can place the syrup in the freezer to speed up this process).

  * ▢

Assemble drinks: Mix ginger syrup with club soda and lime juice (start with
1/4 cup syrup, 2 teaspoons lime juice, and 3/4 cup club soda, then adjust to
taste).

  * ▢

Leftover ginger syrup will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator
for up to one week.

I used to make sodas by fermenting them with yeast. This looks so much easier.

I've made two batches so far, and about to run to the store to replenish my
ginger supply. I'm heavy handed with the lime juice, but this base is
everything you could ask for in a good ginger ale.
