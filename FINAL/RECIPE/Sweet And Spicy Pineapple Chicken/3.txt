Why order Chinese Take-out when this Slow Cooker Sweet and Spicy Pineapple
Chicken is just as good! And putting it together is SO easy! Don't get scared
by the word "spicy" in the title and the red pepper flakes in the photo, you
can make this as mild or as spicy as you want.

But this is just too good. It's got a nice thick sauce that mixes perfectly
with the rice. This will be a hit for your family for sure!

Remember that when you drain the pineapple chunks, keep some of the pineapple
juice! you will want about 1/2 cup to put in the slow cooker with everything
else.

Now there is a small step at the end, but that's almost a requirement if you
want a thick sauce. I just haven't found a way to thicken sauces in the slow
cooker without having that extra step at the end. And honestly, it will take
you literally less than 5 minutes.

And if you like this one, you might be interested in 40 other slow cooker dump
recipes that are AMAZING!
