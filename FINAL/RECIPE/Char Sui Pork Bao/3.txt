## Steamed BBQ Pork Buns

One of my favourite dishes at Yum Cha are **Steamed BBQ Pork Buns** , also
called **Char Siu Bao**. As a child, I tried to only eat them towards the end
of the meal because they tend to be quite filling. But even after stuffing
myself silly with more dumplings than we should have ordered, I still somehow
found appetite left for a Char Siu Bao or two.

These days, as both Yum Cha and Steamed BBQ Pork Buns don't exist where I
live, I find myself making a large batch which my family eats as a complete
meal. That is, dinner will be 3-4 buns per person, together with some steamed
Chinese greens - my idea of heaven!

## BBQ Pork Bun Recipe

Two of the most popular recipes here on my website are my Steamed Bao Buns and
Chinese Barbecue Pork (Char Siu Pork).

And I finally got around to **combining both of these recipes** to make these
**Steamed BBQ Pork Buns**.

What often prompts me to make these buns is when I have **leftover Char Siu
Pork**. In fact, I frequently make 1.5 or double the recipe for Char Siu Pork,
just so I can have leftovers for other dishes, such as Wonton Soup, Fried
Rice, or these Char Siu Buns.

## How to Make Steamed BBQ Pork Buns

Making your own Steamed BBQ Pork Buns requires the following steps:

  1. If you wish to make your own Chinese BBQ pork, I recommend making it at least the day before. The Chinese BBQ pork can even be made 3-4 days in advance. Alternatively, you can buy it from your local Chinatown.
  2. Make the bao bun dough, which takes about **20 minutes** with an electric stand-mixer. You will need to start this step at least 3 hours before you intend to serve, possibly longer if you are not familiar with shaping buns and dumplings.
  3. Leave the bao bun dough to rise for the first time, about **90 minutes**.
  4. Make the Chinese BBQ pork filling, which I tend to do while the bao bun dough is rising the first time. The filling only takes about **10 minutes** to make.
  5. Shape the buns. Depending on your experience, this step could take about **30 minutes** or longer.
  6. Leave the prepared buns to rise for the second time, about **30 minutes**.
  7. Steam the buns. This step takes about **12 minutes**.

## Making the Chinese BBQ Pork Filling

Steamed BBQ Pork Buns need Chinese BBQ pork for the filling. If there is a
Chinatown in your area, you can use store-bought Char Siu Pork for this
recipe. Otherwise, you can give my recipe for Chinese Barbecue Pork (Char Siu
Pork) a try.

I recommend making the pork the day at least the day before. For this BBQ Pork
Bun recipe, you will only need about **half of loin of Char Siu Pork** for the
filling.

Once you have the Char Siu Pork to hand, the filling only takes about **10
minutes** to put together. It will be a very thick filling but, once steamed
inside the buns, the filling will be **deliciously saucy and slightly runny**.

## Making the Steamed Bao Bun Dough

For the bao bun component, I recommend my recipe for Steamed Bao Buns. Follow
this recipe until you need to roll out and shape the dough.

My bao bun recipe makes enough dough for **10-12 stuffed buns** , depending on
the size of your buns.

To shape the buns, you will need to prepare the dough as though it were a
large dumpling. That is, roll out the pieces of dough into a large round, with
the edges slightly thinner than the centre of the dough.

Place some filling in the centre of the dough, and then shape the buns by
crimping the edges, much like making a soup dumpling.

I will update this Steamed BBQ Pork Bun recipe with step-by-step photos soon!

## How to Freeze Char Siu Bao Buns

As a busy working mother, I like to keep our freezer well-stocked with our
favourite foods which we can defrost at a moment's notice. To that end, I try
to go the extra mile when I cook so that we have leftovers which can be stored
in the freezer.

For these Char Siu Bao Buns, I like to make a **double batch** at a time.
Especially if the Chinese Barbecue Pork has been made in advance, I won't
hesitate to make a double batch of the bao bun dough. And as I am familiar
with shaping and crimping bao buns and dumplings, it usually doesn't take me
too long to roll out the dough and shape each bun. It also helps that I have a
**steam oven** which is large enough to steam a whole sheet pan of buns (up to
12) at a time.

One batch (about 10-12 buns) will usually be enough for dinner for 4 with a
side of steamed Chinese greens. During dinner, I will steam the second batch
which will later be put away into freezer bags.

To reheat, simply re-steam the frozen (and cooked) buns for about **10
minutes** , or until they are piping hot throughout.

## How to Serve BBQ Pork Buns

These BBQ Pork Buns are almost a meal in themselves! You can serve them just
as they are as a snack, or turn it into a more substantial meal by serving
**steamed Chinese greens** on the side.

Some chilli sauce or Sriracha is a must for me.

And just in case you were wondering, all bao buns should be **eaten with the
hands** - no knife and fork, please! Think of them like a hamburger üòâ

### Ingredients

**For the Steamed Bao Buns**

  * 300 g (2 cups) plain flour (all-purpose flour) or bleached flour
  * 125 g (1 cup) cornflour (cornstarch)
  * 5 tablespoons caster sugar (super-fine sugar)
  * 1 teaspoon instant yeast (also called instant dried yeast or fast-action dried yeast) (see Kitchen Notes)
  * 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
  * 180 ml (3/4 cup) warm water
  * 60 ml (1/4 cup) vegetable oil, plus extra

**For the Char Siu Pork Filling**

  * 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
  * 1 shallot or small red onion, finely chopped
  * 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
  * pinch of sea salt
  * 2 tablespoons sugar
  * 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  * 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
  * 2 teaspoons sesame oil
  * 2 teaspoons dark soy sauce
  * 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
  * 125 ml (1/2 cup) chicken stock
  * 1/2 loin of Chinese BBQ Pork (Char Siu Pork), either shop-bought or homemade, chopped into small dices
  * 2 tablespoons cornflour (cornstarch) mixed with some water

### Instructions

**To prepare the bao bun dough (Please see my recipe forSteamed Bao Buns for
step-by-step photos)**

  1. Measure all of the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of an electric stand-mixer (if using).
  2. Measure the warm water and oil into a measuring jug. The water needs to be a bit more than lukewarm to help activate the yeast, but it shouldn't be boiling hot.
  3. Using the **dough hook** on **medium speed** , mixing the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients. Depending on the type of flour which you have used, you might need more or less liquid that than stated in the recipe.
  4. Once you have a **sticky dough** , continue kneading the dough on **medium speed** until it becomes **soft and smooth** to touch. This should take about **10 minutes using the stand-mixer** on medium speed, or about **5 minutes by hand**.
  5. Once the dough is soft and smooth, I recommend kneading it by hand for a few more minutes on the kitchen benchtop.
  6. Place the ball of dough back into the (clean) mixing bowl.
  7. Cover the bowl with some cling film or a re-usable bowl cover.
  8. Place the bowl somewhere warm for about **60 to 90 minutes** for the dough to rise and **double in size**.

**To prepare the Char Siu Pork filling**

  1. Place the oil, shallots, garlic and sea salt into a small saucepan over **medium-high heat**.
  2. Saut√© the shallots and garlic until they have softened and are aromatic.
  3. Add the sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, dark soy sauce and pepper.
  4. Simmer gently for a few minutes.
  5. Add the chopped pork.
  6. Simmer for a few more minutes until the pork has warmed through.
  7. With the sauce on a **medium simmer** , pour in the cornflour (cornstarch) slurry.
  8. Stir until the mixture thickens. You want a fairly thick mixture so that the filling does not run everywhere when you eat it.
  9. Transfer the mixture to a large, shallow bowl and allow it to cool completely. The mixture will thicken more upon cooling.

**To roll out the bao bun dough**

  1. Place the dough onto a clean surface and knead it gently a few times with your hands.
  2. Use a large rolling pin to roll it out into a large rectangle shape.
  3. Fold the rectangle in half, from left to right.
  4. Then fold the rectangle in half again, from top to bottom.
  5. Use the rolling pin to flatten and shape the dough into a large rectangle.
  6. With the longer side of the rectangle in front of you, roll the dough into a log.
  7. Divide the dough into **10 equal pieces** with a sharp knife.

**To shape the buns**

  1. Take a piece of dough and use a small rolling pin to roll it into a flat, round shape.
  2. Then use the rolling pin to thin and stretch out the edges, so that the middle of the dough is slightly thicker than the edges. The dough should measure approx. **15 cm** / **6 inches** in diameter **.**
  3. Place the rolled out dough into your left hand (if you are right-handed).
  4. Place a tablespoon of the filling into the centre of the dough.
  5. Use the thumb and index finger on your right hand to crimp the edges of the dough together.
  6. Pinch the crimped edges together, and twist slightly to seal the buns.
  7. Place the prepared bun onto a large baking sheet lined with baking paper.
  8. Repeat the above steps for the remaining buns.
  9. Once all of the buns have been prepared, cover them with a clean, damp tea towel. Place the tray somewhere warm for about **30 minutes** , or until the buns are slightly puffed.

**To steam the buns**

  1. Meanwhile, prepare the steamer on the stove (see Kitchen Notes below).
  2. Steam the buns in batches for **10 to 12 minutes** , or until they are puffy and soft, and cooked all the way through.
  3. Serve the buns immediately.

### Kitchen Notes

**DIFFERENT TYPES OF YEAST**  
* Please note that there is a difference between **instant yeast** (also called **instant dried yeast** or **fast-action dried yeast** ) and **dried yeast** (also called **active dry yeast** ). If you are not sure what type of yeast you have, please check the packaging for instructions on how to use the yeast.  
* With **instant yeast** , you can add it directly to the flour mixture without having to activate it first.  
* If you do not have instant yeast, I would suggest using the same amount of **dried yeast**. In which case, add the dried yeast to the warm water and set it aside for about 5 minutes until it is frothy. Add this yeast mixture, along with the vegetable oil, to the dry ingredients in the recipe above.

**WHAT TYPE OF FLOUR TO USE  
** * Plain flour (all-purpose flour) works well in this recipe as the
cornflour (cornstarch) helps to give the buns a light and fluffy texture.
However, the resulting buns will be a pale yellow in colour.  
* For snowy white buns like those sold in Chinese restaurants, you can use bleached flour found in Asian grocery stores.

**HOW TO STEAM BAO BUNS**  
* The steamer basket (whether bamboo or otherwise) should sit directly on top of a saucepan of the same dimension.  
* Fill the saucepan with boiling water until about one-third full.  
* Place the steamer basket on top of the saucepan.  
* Place the bao buns in the steamer basket, leaving a bit of room for each to rise and puff up during cooking.  
* Place the lid on top of the steamer basket.  
* Steam over low-medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes.

**HOW TO MAKE BAO BUNS WITH A STEAM OVEN**  
* **First Proof** : Cover the bowl with some cling film or a re-usable bowl cover. Proof the dough in the steam oven/combi-steam oven at **40¬∞C** / **104¬∞F** for about **1.5 hours** , or until the dough has doubled in size.  
* **Second Proof** : Once you have shaped the bao buns, place them onto a large tray (lined with baking paper) that will fit inside your steam oven/combi-steam oven. For my steam oven, I can fit a large sheet pan, which will comfortably fit 12 bao buns. There is no need to cover the buns. Proof the shaped bao buns at **40¬∞C** / **104¬∞F** for about **30 minutes** , or until the buns have puffed up slightly.  
* **Steaming the Bao Buns** : Remove the tray of bao buns from the steam oven/combi-steam oven. Increase the temperature to **100¬∞C** / **212¬∞F**. Once the steam oven/combi-steam oven has come to temperature, place the tray of bao buns back inside and steam them for **10-12 minutes**.

**HOW TO FREEZE BAO BUNS**  
Any leftover steamed buns can be frozen in zip-lock bags for 1-2 months.
Reheat the frozen steamed buns in a steamer or steam oven for about 10
minutes, or until they are warmed all the way through.
