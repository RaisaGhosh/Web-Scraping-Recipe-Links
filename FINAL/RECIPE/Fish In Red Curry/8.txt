## How to make Thai red coconut fish curry

  1. **Sear the fish:** Pat the fish dry with paper towels then drizzle with a little oil and season with salt. Sear in a hot pan until golden brown on both sides then remove and set aside.
  2. **Make the curry:** In the same pan, sauté the onion and garlic until soft and translucent. Add the curry paste and cook for a few minutes until fragrant. Pour in the coconut milk, fish sauce, lime juice and brown sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook for 8-10 minutes, until slightly thicker. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Add the fish to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until the fish is fully cooked.
  3. **Serve:** Scatter over fresh herbs and finely sliced chillies then serve with lime wedges and steamed rice.

## Can I add vegetables to this curry?

Absolutely. Red bell peppers, sugar snap or snow peas, broccoli, bok choy,
spinach or green beans would all be delicious in this fish curry. Cook the
vegetables with the onion and simmer in the sauce to allow time to cook
thoroughly before adding the fish.

## Can I make this ahead?

The sauce can be made up to 2 days ahead and kept in the fridge. Reheat in the
pan and add the fish to cook through. Leftover curry can be kept in the fridge
for a day and reheated over gentle heat.
