This easy Thai red fish curry is vibrant, delicious, and ready in just 30
minutes. White fish is poached in a delicious coconut sauce that's also loaded
with veggies and spices for a flavourful dish the entire family will love.

Fish curry with coconut milk is one of the most delicious things I've ever
cooked, and that's no exaggeration.

Vibrant, full of nutrients, and dairy-free â€” what more could you ask from a
Thai red fish curry?

This fish coconut curry pairs great with some freshly boiled jasmine rice, and
you can make it as fiery as you want by simply adjusting the amount of Thai
red paste you use.

I love to make this Thai fish curry with sweet potatoes, but you can actually
make it with just about any veggies you want.

You can add bell peppers, pak choi, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower florets,
and anything else you want.

## Ingredients and substitutions

**Coconut oil â€”** I use coconut oil in this curry because it pairs well with
the coconut milk and the rest of the flavours, but you can use any other type
of vegetable oil you want.

**Garlic, ginger and lemongrass â€”**  Use fresh ingredients instead of the
stuff that comes in jars. Yes, it takes longer to prep them, but the result is
so worth it.

**Thai red paste â€”** Try to get some quality Thai red paste, as it really
makes a difference. I typically use the stuff from Blue Dragon in the UK.

**Sweet potato â€”**  As mentioned above, you can use any kind of veggies you
want for this Thai fish curry. I like to make it with sweet potatoes because
they add extra creaminess to the curry as they cook. Plus, have I mentioned
how delicious they are in a curry?

**Whitefish â€”**  You can use any type of white fish you want for this curry.
Haddock and cod are both excellent ideas.

**Coconut milk**  â€” I make this fish curry with light coconut milk, but you
can use a full-fat version if you'd like it to be creamier.

**Lime juice**  â€” A dash of lime juice will add extra brightness and freshness
to this fish curry.

## How do you make Thai red fish curry?

This is just one of those recipes that can be on your table in just 30
minutes.

Here's how to make this easy fish curry step by step.

  * Heat the coconut oil in a large pan with a lid and fry the onion, red pepper and green beans for 3-4 minutes.
  * Stir in the garlic, ginger and lemongrass and continue to cook for another minute until fragrant.

  * Next, stir in the Thai red paste and cook for another minute. Add the sweet potato, fish stock and coconut milk and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes until the sauce thickens a bit.
  * Give the sauce a good stir, and then add the chunks of fish on top. Cover with a lid and cook for 4-5 minutes until the fish is flakey.
  * Add the lime juice and fresh coriander and serve over jasmine rice.

## Recipe notes and tips

  * To make your own customized version of this hearty curry, use whichever vegetables are in season.
  * Because some Tahi red curry pastes are spicy, be sure to taste yours before adjusting the amount in this recipe.
  * Cut the fish in approximately equal chunks to make sure it cooks evenly.
  * The fish curry will keep well in the fridge in an airtight container for up to three days. You can easily reheat it on the stove or in the microwave.
