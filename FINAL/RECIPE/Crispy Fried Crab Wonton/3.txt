_This warm and cheesy Crab Rangoon Dip is so easy to make and is served with
golden fried wontons for dipping. Prepare the entire dip up to **two days
ahead of time** and pop it in the oven when you're ready to serve it!_

_"_ Mmmmm, this is _really_ good, _Crab_ Rangoon _should_ be a dip!" - my
husband.

I couldn't agree more. **Crab Rangoon in Dip form** is perfect because the
wonton chips are soo crunchy and can hold as much dip as your heart desires.

Don't get me wrong, classic Crab Rangoon is perfect too. But this is somewhat
easier because you don't have to worry about folding all of those little
wontons into fancy shapes. ðŸ˜‰

## Make-Ahead Crab Rangoon Dip

You can fully assemble this dip and refrigerate it in a covered airtight
container for up to **two days** before baking.

## Where to Find Wonton Wraps

I use Nasoya Wonton Wraps, they are in the **produce section** in the
**refrigerated area** where you would also find tofu, egg roll wraps, perhaps
refrigerated salad dressings and salsa, etc.

## Baked Wonton Chips

Baking the wontons is an alternative to frying them. (Although you can't beat
the flavor and crunch of frying them. Just saying. ðŸ˜‡) -But if you'd prefer to
bake, here's how:

  * Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
  * Cut the wontons in half diagonally and spray them with olive or avocado oil.
  * Sprinkle with salt.
  * Place on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake for 6 minutes, until they're a light golden brown.

Since I _always_ fry my chips, I obtained these baking instructions from
minimalist baker.

## My Kitchen Tools For This Recipe

Deep Fryer - Inexpensive, and heats the oil to just the right temperature
without the need for an oil thermometer.

Dutch Oven - A nice alternative to a deep fryer, these conduct heat really
well for even cooking.

Oil Thermometer- Helpful if you don't have a deep fryer.

Kitchen Tongs - For handling the wontons while they're being fried.

Hand Mixer - To mix the dip.

Silicone Spatula- To incorporate additional ingredients into the dip.

This warm and cheesy Crab Rangoon Dip is so easy to make and is served with
golden fried wontons for dipping. Prepare the entire dip up to two days ahead
of time and pop it in the oven when you're ready to serve it!

### Ingredients

US Customary \- Metric

  * â–¢ 8 oz. Cream Cheese, softened
  * â–¢ Â½ cup sour cream
  * â–¢ 1 teaspoon soy sauce
  * â–¢ 2 teaspoons brown sugar
  * â–¢ 1 clove minced garlic
  * â–¢ 3 oz. canned crab meat
  * â–¢ 1 cup Mozzarella cheese, separated*
  * â–¢ 4 diced green onions, separated
  * â–¢ 12 oz. wonton wraps
  * â–¢ 1 quart vegetable oil

### Instructions

#### Making The Dip

  * Note: Make sure your cream cheese has had time to sit out and get very soft, it will be nice and smooth that way. Otherwise it will become lumpy when combined with the other ingredients.

  * Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

  * Beat the cream cheese with a hand mixer in a large bowl.

  * Add the sour cream and soy sauce and beat to combine.

  * Add the brown sugar, garlic, crab meat, **half** of the cheese, and **half** of the green onions. Use a silicone spatula to combine.

  * Add the dip to a small baking dish and top with remaining cheese.

  * Bake, covered, for 20 minutes.

  * Remove the cover and bake for an additional 10 minutes, until the cheese is hot, melted, and begins to brown.

  * Sprinkle the other half of the diced onions over the dip and serve with wonton chips!

#### Making the Wonton Chips

  * Add the oil to a dutch oven or use a deep fryer. Use an oil thermometer if possible, the oil should be at about 325 degrees.

  * Cut each wonton wrap in half diagonally. Fry them in batches of 5. Use kitchen tongs to lower them into the oil and flip them as they cook so that they brown on each side.

  * Remove the wontons from the oil as soon as they are lightly browned on each side. They quickly change from light, golden brown to a dark brown so work quickly and watch them.

  * Place the fried wontons on a paper towel lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Repeat until all of the wontons are fried. Serve the chips with the Crab Rangoon Dip and enjoy!
