Step 4: Add 2 tablespoons corn flour to mixture.

Step 5: Crush fresh ginger.

Step 6: Finely chop up fresh garlic cloves.

Step 7: Add two teaspoons crushed ginger and two teaspoons finely chopped
garlic to the mixture.

Step 8: Mix ingredients together to form a marinade for the chicken.

Step 9: Add the chicken pieces to the bowl.

Step 10: Mix the chicken pieces and marinade together. Make sure the chicken
pieces are all evenly covered with the marinade.

and bake at 180 degrees centigrade for 30-40 minutes.
