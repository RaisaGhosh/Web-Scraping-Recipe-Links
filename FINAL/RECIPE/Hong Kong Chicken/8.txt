# Hongkong Chicken

Hongkong Chicken  
  
During the 80âs and 90âs, there was a popular Chinese restaurant in
Monumento, Caloocan (Philippines), called Pines Restaurant.  
  
It was a small restaurant, but the ambiance takes you to that feeling like you
are in Binondo, Chinatown. The food were great and very affordable.  
  
There was this one dish that was really very popular at this restaurant back
then, the âHongkong Chickenâ.  
  
A chicken dish with thick sauce, crisp vegetables, and 'Tengang Daga'
mushrooms.  
  
At that time Hongkong chicken was my comfort food, because of the savory taste
of chicken, the aroma of star anise & ginger, the sweetness of the sauce and
the crunchiness of vegetables.  
  
In the year 2000, we moved to Mandaluyong City, and that meant missing this
dish for a while.  
  
So one time, I visited a friend somewhere in Caloocan City, and thought of
stopping by the Pines restaurant, but felt a bit disappointed when I found out
that the restaurant was no longer around.  
  
That is when I tried to remake the taste of famous Hongkong chicken of Pines
just to satisfy my cravings.  
  
I tried several attempts, until one day I knew it was almost like it.  
  
Now, I could say that it is one of my specialty and personal favorites. I even
won a cooking contest for this dish.  
  
This is the most requested dish by my family and friends, and I would also
love to share my own 'Hongkong chicken ala Pines' to you.
