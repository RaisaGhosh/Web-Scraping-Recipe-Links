Chicken Hong Kong is a special chicken recipe inspired by ingredients and
techniques from Hong Kong.  
  
The spicy chicken marinade in Chicken Hong Kong involves a blend of tasty
ingredients like soya sauce, eggs, corn flour, white pepper powder and
vinegar. The fried chicken is sauted with a bunch of ingredients and then
simmered along with the corn flour solution to get that desired thick
consistency.  
  
Chicken Hong Kong is a high-protein dish that goes well with fried rice or
noodles.
