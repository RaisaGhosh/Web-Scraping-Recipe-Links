Perfect for a busy weeknight family dinner! I was tempted to eat these noodles
right out of the skillet. If youâ€™ve never tried a **chicken pad thai recipe**
you should try this one, youâ€™ll love it.

## Pad Thai Sauceâ€¦

The secret of any delicious pad thai noodle is the - delectable sauce. It has
to have a real outburst of flavors - **sweet, spicy, tangy and sour**.

No readymade sauce can deliver all those flavors in one dish. That is the
reason I stick to my homemade pad thai sauce. It is super simple to prepare
and takes the flavor of noodles to just another level of deliciousness.

The best part of this sauce is it can be **stored in the fridge for a week**.
The magical ingredient of this finger-licking good pad thai sauce is -
tamarind paste.

The sourness of tamarind is balanced by the sweetness of brown sugar and the
heat of red chili sauce. Together these flavors create a delectable sauce that
you would be tempted to lick while making itself.

## Pad Thai Noodlesâ€¦

Unlike, other Asian noodles variety, pad thai noodles need to be handled with
care. **Rice noodles are gluten-free** and have a delicate texture. Hence,
they cannot tolerate any kind of vigorous cooking process. For many of us,
dealing with rice noodles can be a bit tricky in the first attempt.

The best way to soften the rice noodles to make pad thai is to soak in boiling
water for 5 - 10 minutes. The soaking time depends on the quality of the
noodles. Also, while soaking the noodles just make sure to cover the pan with
a lid.

Many times, instructions on the pack of rice noodles says, ' **soak in cold
water '**. Sorry! But that never ever worked for me. And please don't even try
to expedite the softening process by adding rice noodles to a pot of boiling
water like pasta. It will be a total disaster!

Everything about this chicken pad thai screams deliciousness. Though it takes
me 30 minutes to get it on the table it's gone in less than 15 minutes. We all
need such quick and comforting recipes in our life. This pad noodles recipe is
also easily customizable as well:

**âˆš for vegetarian pad thai - skip chicken and fish sauce**

**âˆš for vegan pad thai - add tofu instead of chicken and skip the fish sauce**

**âˆš for seafood pad thai - add plenty of shellfish (prawns, squids, shrimps)
**

Also, Iâ€™m not picky about the veggies you use, add whatever youâ€™ve got - **bok
choy, broccoli, mushrooms, spinach, bell peppers, carrot, seaweed**. Anything
you love, just dump it in the wok and combine with the sauce and noodles.

A hearty bowl of pad thai noodle is ready for you to devour. It has noodles,
veggies, meat, and lots of peanuts, what not to love about it.

### Instructions

#### How To Prepare Rice Noodles:

  * Place rice noodles in a large flat bowl. Pour boiling water over the noodles. Cover the bowl with a lid. After 5 minutes, open the lid and gently soak the noodles in water and cover the bowl once again. Open the lid exactly after 5 minutes. 

  * Transfer the softened noodles into a colander. Drain all the liquid. Quickly rinse with cold/running water. 

#### How To Make Pad Thai Sauce:

  * Combine all the ingredients for sauce in a bowl. Whisk nicely until well combined. Taste and adjust the amount of sugar/red chilli sauce as per your preference. Set aside. 

#### How To Make Chicken Pad Thai:

  * Toss chicken strips in 2 tablespoons of pad thai sauce and mix nicely. Set aside. 

  * Heat oil in a wok or stir-fry pan. Add chopped garlic. Stir-fry for a minute. 

  * Add sliced onion and fry them for a minute or so. Keep the gas flame from medium-high.

  * Next, add the marinated chicken strips. And stir-fry till the chicken is tender and cooked. This does not take more than 5 - 10 minutes.

### Recipe Notes:

  * Do not leave the rice stocks/noodles in the warm water for a very long time. Approximately 10 - 15 minutes is the good enough time or keep on checking them for doneness. 
  * Do not toss the noodles vigorously else they will break apart. 
  * For a more intense flavour, chicken can be marinated 1 - 2 hour before and kept in the fridge. 
  * Chicken Pad Thai is best enjoyed fresh and warm. It may not taste the same after a few hours. 
  * Always, taste the pad thai sauce and add more sugar/sauces/salt accordingly.
