_Easy homemade chicken ramen, with a flavorful broth, roasted chicken, fresh
veggies, lots of noodles, and a soft cooked egg. Inspired by traditional
Japanese ramen, but on the table in under an hour._

The Honeyâ€™s parents are American ex-pats living abroad in Tokyo, Japan, and
while visiting them over the last seven or eight years, heâ€™s collected dozens
of favorite eateries throughout the city.

Thereâ€™s the best _izakaya_ in Kichijoji, serving up casual Japanese pub food,
and countless _kiten-zushi_ restaurants, where my English-speaking Honey can
choose small plates of freshly-made sushi from a moving conveyor belt without
having to order in Japanese.

He always makes sure to buy at least one _Pocari Sweat_ from a vending machine
_(think Japanese gatorade)_ , and of course, thereâ€™s his favorite ramen shop
in Shinjuku, a tiny, crowded restaurant with a line out the door. Paintings of
pigs adorn the walls, and big, steaming bowls of pork ramen are served to
hungry patrons at a single bar counter.

## what you'll love about this easy chicken ramen

Real Japanese ramen, the kind that my Honey tells stories about, takes years
and great skill to perfect. I wanted to create a simple ramen noodle soup that
reminded him of Japan, but could be made quickly, with ingredients on hand.

I opted for chicken instead of pork, but kept the rest of the ramen vibe
somewhat traditional: a killer chicken soup base with garlic, ginger, shitake
mushrooms and soy sauce, filled with squiggly ramen noodles and slices of
succulent chicken, and topped with fresh spring onions and a soft-boiled egg.

My version is on the table in less than an hour - and half that if you opt for
store-bought chicken - and while it might not be completely authentic, itâ€™s a
flavorful, comforting soup just in time for the unmistakably crisp, chilly
autumn weather that these first days of October have ushered in.

### Description

_Easy homemade chicken ramen, with a flavorful broth, roasted chicken, fresh
veggies, lots of noodles, and a soft cooked egg. Inspired by traditional
Japanese ramen, but on the table in under an hour._

* * *

### Ingredients

Scale 1x2x3x

  * **2** chicken breasts (boneless, skin-on)*
  * kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper, _to season_
  * **1 Tbsp** unsalted butter
  * **2 tsp** sesame or vegetable oil
  * **2 tsp** fresh ginger, minced
  * **1 Tbsp** fresh garlic, minced
  * **3 Tbsp** low-sodium soy sauce
  * **2 Tbsp** mirin
  * **4 cups** rich chicken stock
  * **1 oz** dried shitake mushrooms (or 1/2 cup fresh)
  * **1 -2 tsp** sea salt, _to taste_
  * **2** large eggs
  * **1/2 cup** scallions, _sliced_
  * **2 (3 oz)** packs dried ramen noodles
  * optional: fresh jalapeÃ±o or chili slices, _for serving_

* * *

### Instructions

#### Cook the chicken: Â¹

  1. Preheat the oven to 375â„‰. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.
  2. Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.
  3. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate, and cover with foil until ready to serve.

#### Make the ramen broth:

  1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to combine. Cook for another minute.
  2. Add the stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer uncovered for 5 minutes, then add the dried mushrooms. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.

#### Make the soft-boiled eggs:

  1. Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yolk) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yolk).
  2. Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to serve.

#### Assemble the ramen bowls:

  1. Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeÃ±o (if using). Slice the chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. When the eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.
  2. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. Top with the fresh scallions, jalapeÃ±o, and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately. Enjoy!!

### Notes

Â¹ Ask your butcher to remove the rib bone from the chicken breasts (leaving
the skin on), or use bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts and increase the oven
roasting time 5-10 minutes, as needed. You can also cut your ramen prep time
in half by using a store-bought whole rotisserie chicken, simply slice off as
much as you wish, and add to the ramen.

This was my first ramen attempt and although I will refine it a bit for our
tastes, it was super yummy and we will definitely be making this again. The
noodles I used were called ramen noodles but they were quite thick, more like
a wudong and we would prefer a lighter noodle. We also need proper ramen
bowls, the ones we had were a bit small so everything was a bit crowded in.
But 9/10 for one of the more accessible and easy ramen recipes. Kudos from New
Zealand!

Iâ€™ve made this recipe several times and tried a few others. We always come
back to this one because itâ€™s just perfect and others do not compare. Question
though, do you think beef stock would work with this same recipe?

â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…

    * **Laura** -- June 30, 2022  Reply

Hi Michelle! So happy to hear our version is a fave ðŸ™‚ I haven't personally
made this recipe using beef stock, but I know some readers have tried it. Beef
stock tends to have a stronger flavor which can be overwhelming. You may have
to taste/adjust as you're cooking to make sure everything is balanced. I have
used veggie stock and that works well with the original recipe. You can also
replace the roasted chicken with beef (I think a flank steak or similar would
be great), if you're looking for more of that flavor without having to change
anything else. Enjoy!!

This was AMAZING! Such a good recipe. I did beef it up a bitâ€¦.I doubled the
garlic, ginger and added the white bottoms of scallions to the saute at the
beginning. I also added fresh mushrooms, broccoli and spinach. I used chicken
thighs because it's what I had on hand and they turned out perfectly using
this cooking method.

Oh yay! Thanks so much, Briana! The extra veggies sound delish, too ðŸ™‚

I use this recipe once a month and its my favorite. I add more spices to my
chicken and add extra garlic and ginger to my broth. Its so good.
