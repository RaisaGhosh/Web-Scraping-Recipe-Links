# Chili Crab Recipe

Jump to Recipe Print Recipe

Chili Crab is a seafood dish that I enjoy with lots of rice. This dish is
composed of crab (Mud Crab is originally used) cooked in sweet and spicy
sauce.I had my first taste of this dish in the original dampa in Paranaque (a
city in the Philippines).

I found this to be real good and the three servings of rice can attest to
that. Imagine the meaty claws of the alimango topped with sweet and spicy
sauce â€¦now that makes me really craving for more. Wouldn't you want to try
some or perhaps cook your own chili crab? If your answer is yes, then we have
the solution right here.

Try this Chili Crab recipe.

Bought 3 huge dungeness crabs at Half Moon Bay (California) this morning. I
just wasn't sure how to kill them. Thankfully my daughter did. Cooked them
using your recipe. Huge hit with the family. Thanks a million for your recipes
and website. I didn't have any chili peppers so used sambal oelek instead.
Yummy!

victoria, there is no single ingredient that you can use as an alternative for
hoisin sauce. Though you make your own hoisin sauce by mixing at least 5
ingredients -- but I doubt if all of them will also be available in your
place.

The best thing for you to do is go to a chinese grocery and look for one.

thanks for your wonderful recipes! it really helps me make my fave filipino
food now that i am in the USâ€¦. btw, i just have a quick questionâ€¦ I haven't
really tried cooking crab. Did you cook the crabs first before you halved
them? If you did, how?

More power!

I did steam them because I intended to cook them after a day otherwise no
steaming is needed. Crabs are best cooked fresh.
