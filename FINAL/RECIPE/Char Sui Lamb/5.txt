## Ingredients

Serves: 3-4 people

### Main Ingredients

  * 12 lamb cutlets 
  * 3 heads of bok choy (halved lengthwise) 

### Marinade

  * 3 tbsp hoisin sauce 
  * 4 tbsp soy sauce 
  * 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine 
  * 1 tbsp sugar 
  * 1 tsp five-spice powder 
  * Â½ tsp salt 

### Sauce

  * 2 tbsp honey 
  * 1 tbsp water 

## Directions

### To Prep

  1. Combine all of the marinade ingredients and mix well.
  2. Transfer the marinade into a resealable bag and add the lamb. Mix the lamb to coat with the marinade, seal and marinate for at least 3 hrs.
  3. Once the meat has marinated, cut the bok choy in half lengthwise.

### To Cook

  1. Prepare the barbecue to cook.
  2. Remove the lamb from the bag and transfer to the barbecue.
  3. While the lamb is cooking, add the halves of bok choy to the barbecue to cook.
  4. Grill the lamb chops until lightly charred on both sides.
  5. When the lamb has been cooked to the desired level of doneness, remove from the barbecue and let the meat rest for at least 5 mins.
  6. While the meat rests, in a small bowl combine the honey and water together.

### The leftover marinade can also be used to make a savoury sauce for the
lamb chops. To do this:

  1. Transfer the leftover marinade in to a small saucepan and add about 4 tbsp of water.
  2. Bring the mixture to a light boil and continue to cook for about 5 mins to ensure that the sauce has cooked through.
  3. Serve with the lamb chops and bok choy.
