I had to post a review for this. More than 5 stars! I used lamb cutlets to cut
down on cooking/serving time as I had a large party to cater for. It was
sensational. I just roasted the lamb cutlets and served them a top potato
rosti's and sauteed spinach. I did not make the mango salsa as I was serving
mango for dessert.

Excellent twist on a rack of lamb ! The glaze was the final touch, and now I
understand the hint about the foil .....

In my previous review I made a bad typo--the flavors are intense but DO NOT
overpower the lamb!! This has become my favorite rack of lamb preparation. I
have been asked for the recipe each time I have served it to a group. Very
easy and the timing is perfect for nice, pink lamb. I pour the pan juices over
the chops after slicing---heavenly!!!
