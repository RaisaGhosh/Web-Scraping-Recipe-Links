#### 3 Method Steps

  * Step 1

Mix the char siu sauce, honey and lime juice in a large dish. Add the lamb and
coat well. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 6 hours or overnight.

  * Step 2

Preheat the oven to 200°C (190°C fan-forced). For dressing, put cucumber in a
sieve over a bowl, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt, then stand for 5 minutes.
Rinse, then dry on paper towel. Dissolve sugar with 1 tablespoon water in a
small pan over medium heat and stir to dissolve. Simmer for 2 minutes, then
add vinegar and lime. Set aside to cool. Stir in remaining ingredients when
ready to serve.

  * Step 3

Heat oil in a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add lamb, fat-side
down, and cook for 1-2 minutes each side to brown (they'll be quite dark).
Place in roasting pan, pour over marinade and roast for 15 minutes for medium-
rare, or until cooked to your liking. Rest for 5 minutes, then slice into
cutlets and serve with rice, pan juices and dressing.
