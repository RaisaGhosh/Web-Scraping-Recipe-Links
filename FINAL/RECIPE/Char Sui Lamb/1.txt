Usually used on pork, the Chinese barbecue marinade called _char siu_ gives a
haunting sweetness to these chops, which are delicious with steamed bok choy.

## Ingredients

Makes 6 Servings

3

tablespoons hoisin sauce

3

tablespoons soy sauce

2

tablespoons Shaoxing wine (Chinese rice wine) or dry Sherry

1

tablespoon sugar

1

teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder

1

/2 teaspoon salt

18

rib lamb chops (about 3 pounds), well trimmed

2

tablespoons honey

1

tablespoon water

## Preparation

### Step 1

Whisk first 6 ingredients in small bowl. Transfer to large resealable plastic
bag. Add lamb; seal bag and turn to coat. Marinate in refrigerator at least 4
hours or overnight.

### Step 2

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Drain lamb, leaving some marinade
clinging. Grill lamb until slightly charred and cooked to desired doneness,
about 2 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to platter.

### Step 3

Stir honey and 1 tablespoon water in small skillet over medium heat until
warm. Brush over lamb chops.
