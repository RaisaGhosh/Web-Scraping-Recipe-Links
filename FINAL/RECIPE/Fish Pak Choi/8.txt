  * 1 egg white

  * 2 tsp toasted sesame oil
  * 25g desiccated coconut
  * 1 spring onion, finely chopped
  * 4 x 150g chunky firm white fish fillets (eg cod or haddock), skinless

##### For the ginger pak choi

  * 2 x 200g packs pak choi

  * 1 garlic clove, finely sliced
  * 2cm piece ginger, finely chopped
  * 2 tbsp dry sherry
  * 2 tbsp oyster sauce
  * 1 lime, cut in wedges, to serve

####  Step by step

__________

  1. Preheat the oven to 180°C, fan 160°C, gas 4. Toast the seeds until golden in a dry frying pan, then cool. Reserve 1 teaspoon to serve.
  2. Put the egg white in a small bowl and add the soy sauce, sesame oil, the rest of the sesame seeds, the coconut and spring onion. Mix to a paste. Put the fish on a baking tray; spread with the paste. Bake for 12-14 minutes until the fish flakes easily.
  3. Meanwhile, cut the heads of pak choi into quarters. Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the pak choi for 1-2 minutes with the garlic and ginger until starting to wilt. Mix the sherry and oyster sauce with 4 tbsp water, add to the pan, cover and bring to the boil. The pak choi should be just tender, still with some bite to it. Serve with the fish, some steamed rice sprinkled with the reserved sesame seeds, and lime wedges.
