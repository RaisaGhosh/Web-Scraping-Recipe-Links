### Method

  1. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place each fillet in the centre of a large square of foil. Top with the pak choi, spring onions, chilli and ginger, then pull up the edges of the foil. 

  2. Mix together the soy sauce, lime juice and 1 tbsp of water then spoon a little over each fillet. Crimp the top of the foil to enclose the fish and make sure there are no gaps for the steam to escape. 

  3. Place the parcels on a baking sheet and bake for 10-15 mins until the fish is cooked through (this will depend on the thickness of your fish). Open up the parcels and drizzle over a few drops of sesame oil. Serve with rice.
