### Instructions

1

Cook Rice:

Preheat oven to 200°C. In a medium pot, combine the **rice** with **1 ½ cups
of water** and a pinch of salt. Stir to loosen the rice. Heat the pot to
boiling on high. Once **boiling, cover, then reduce the heat to low** , and
simmer about 15 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked
through. Fluff the finished rice with a fork. Taste the rice; if it is still
too firm, add a few more tablespoons of water. Cover the pot and let the rice
absorb the water off of the heat.

Wash the fresh produce. Cut the ends off the **pak choy**. Zest the **lemon**
, then cut in half. Peel and mince **garlic** and **ginger**. Deseed the
**chili** and small dice, wash your hands immediately after use. Pat dry the
**fish** with paper towel.

Prepare Fish Parcel:

Nestle the **fish fillets** side by side on a **large square of foil**. (Tip:
Ensure foil will be big enough to enclose and cover the vegetables once
added). Scatter the **ginger, garlic, chili** and **lemon zest** over fish.

Add Lemon Juice & Pak Choy:

Squeeze over **half the lemon** **juice** then scatter the **pak choy** around
and on top of the fish.

5

Pour Over Soy Sauce:

Pour the **soy sauce** over the **pak choy** and loosely seal the foil to make
a package, making sure you leave space at the top for the steam to circulate
as the fish cooks. Bake in the oven for 13 to 15 minutes.
