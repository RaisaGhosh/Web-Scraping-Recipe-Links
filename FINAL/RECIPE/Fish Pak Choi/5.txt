1cm piece of ginger, peeled and finely sliced

Juice of 1 lime

1 tablespoon of sunflower oil

1 garlic clove, finely diced

Half a red chilli, finely diced

1 head of pak choi, washed and torn

METHOD

1\. Heat the oven to 200c/180c fan/gas mark 6. Tear two pieces of tin foil,
large enough to make a parcel for each fillet of fish in the centre of the
foil.

2\. Add the soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, spring onions, red chilli and a
squeeze of lime juice on top of the fish.

3\. Wrap up the foil so you have two parcels of fish. Place them on a baking
tray and place in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked
through. Remove from the oven and set aside, in the tin foil, to keep warm
while you prepare the pak choi.

4\. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium to high
heat. Add the diced garlic and the diced red chilli and cook for two minutes.
Add the torn leaves of pak choi and cook for a further two minutes, until the
pak choi has taken on a vibrant green colour but still retains its crunch.

5\. Serve the fish with pak choi and lime wedges on the side.
