I don't have a tandoor (a type of clay oven), but I do like tikka - usually,
small pieces of meat or fish in a spicy marinade, baked in said oven. This
adaptation is a deliciously easy fish dish that I can pop in the oven while I
prepare a stir-fry of veggies, making it perfect for entertaining. In India,
the tikka marinade is made with yoghurt and spices, but since yoghurt with
fish is an Ayurvedic 'no-no', I've swapped it with ghee, which helps to
activate the spices as well as baste the fish. Marinate the fish in advance
for the best flavour, then bring to room temperature before cooking. The whole
dish comes together really easily and looks the business. - Jasmine Hemsley
