# Devil’s Shrimp with Brandy & Fresh Tomatoes

Devil's Shrimp

While self-quarantining these days, I’m cooking even more often than usual. I
might attribute this increase to my attempt to avoid waste by using up
ingredients before they go bad. I’m sure many of you face the same
predicament. We buy more than we need at the market fearing that a long
sought-after item might not be available the next time we’re there.

A recent case in point for me was with Roma tomatoes. Because the ones I
purchased needed a little more ripening, I had set them aside on window sill
where they enjoyed some California sunshine. Well, the proverbial out-of-sight
out-of-mind maxim proved true and, if my better half hadn’t noticed them just
in time, they might have been out-of-kitchen.

Fortunately, the tomatoes were perfectly ripe and I had just enough for a
shrimp recipe that I had recently dog-eared in Giuliano Hazan’s _Every Night
Italian_. Although Giuliano may not have achieved the culinary status of his
mother Marcella, his recipes are always very good, easy to follow, and
reliable.

The recipe, “Devil’s Shrimp with Brandy and Fresh Tomatoes,” had caught my eye
with its use of brandy, an ingredient that I always use, as did my Neapolitan
aunt, in my lobster f _ra diavolo_. That the recipe required only a modicum of
ingredients and between 35 to 40 minutes to cook made it even more appealing.

Because I hadn’t planned on writing a post about this dish, we didn’t take any
photographs until it was done. But it was so good, in fact one of the best
shrimp dishes I’ve had in quite some time, I decided to write it up along with
the few pictures that I had.

As with any Italian dish that has the word “ _diavolo_ ,” or devil, you can be
sure it will be spicy. The degree of spice, says Hazan, depends on “how
devilish” the cook feels when adding the crushed red-pepper flakes. Even
though I used considerably more than the recipe called for, the spice of the
dish was tempered by the sweetness of the tomatoes and the shrimp.

Aside from increasing the spice, my only other variation from the recipe was
using E-Z peel shrimp, which I cooked with their shells on. Although less
elegant at the table, shrimp cooked in their shells, in my opinion, have much
more flavor and perhaps even better texture.

Close up

**Devil’s Shrimp with Brandy and Fresh Tomatoes** ( _adapted from Giuliano
Hazan’s Every Night Italian_ )

**Ingredients (Serves 4 to 6 people.)**  
1 ½ pounds large shrimp (21-25 per pound)  
12 ounces fresh, ripe plum tomatoes  
2 tablespoons very thinly sliced garlic  
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste  
2 tablespoons brandy or grappa  
Salt  
Torn basil or chopped parsley for garnish (Optional)

**Directions**

1\. Peel the shrimp and devein them if necessary. ( _As I mentioned above, I
used E-Z peel shrimp which were already deveined and in their shells._ )  
2\. Peel the tomatoes, remove the seeds, and cut into narrow strips. ( _To
peel the tomatoes, I followed Hazan’s method of using a sharp vegetable
peeler, illustrated near the front of the book._ )  
3\. Put the garlic and oil in a skillet large enough to accommodate the shrimp
in a single layer and place it over high heat. Sauté the garlic until it
begins to sizzle. ( _For more heat, you might want to add the pepper flakes at
the same time as the garlic; otherwise, follow Hazan and do it in the
following step._ )  
4\. Add the red-pepper flakes and shrimp and sauté very briefly until both
sides of the shrimp begin to change color.  
5\. Using caution, add the brandy and flame it, or cook it for about 10
seconds to evaporate the alcohol. (Flaming is best done on a gas stove. After
adding the brandy, move the skillet so that the edge is over the center of the
burner and tip the pan slightly toward the flame. Be sure to stand back to
avoid getting burned.) ( _I should also warn never pour any alcohol directly
from the bottle; adding alcohol is best done off the stove top._ )  
6\. Add the tomatoes and season with salt. Cook, stirring, until the shrimp
are done, 2 to 3 minutes. ( _If cooking the shrimp with the shell on, it may
take a little longer._ ) Do not over cook the shrimp, or they will become
tough. Serve at once on heated plates.

As you can see, I added some torn basil leaves for added flavor.
