Bafat powder is a readymade powder consisting of the condiments required to
prepare Pork Bafath used instead of grinding masala. It is available in
Mangalorean catholic groceries, bakeries & also in Pork shops.

I am little confused on what to do with Ginger & Garlic used to cook pork?
Also you didnt include the oil in ingredients and as well as the quantity to
be used Can curry powder be used in absence of Bapat powder?
