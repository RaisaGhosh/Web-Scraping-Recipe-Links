Difficulty

    Easy

This stir-fry packs a punch with three types of chilli, and would work just as
well with chicken or minced prawns.

## Ingredients

###

350g pork fillet, finely sliced across the grain

3 tbsp peanut oil

6 long red chillies, halved lengthways and deseeded​

4 cloves garlic, finely chopped

1 tsp chilli powder

½ tsp Sichuan pepper, plus extra to serve

3 tbsp fresh chicken stock

1 tbsp light soy sauce

2 tbsp crushed yellow rock sugar

**For the marinade**

1 tbsp light soy sauce

2 tbsp shaoxing wine

pinch sea salt

2 tsp sesame oil

## Method

**1.  **To make the marinade, mix together all the ingredients.

**2.**  Add the pork, toss to coat and leave for 30 minutes.

**3.  **Heat a wok until just smoking. Add the peanut oil, drain the pork and
cook with chillies in 2 batches until the pork is well browned, then remove.

**4.  **Reheat wok and stir-fry the garlic, chilli powder and Sichuan pepper
for 30 seconds, then add the stock, soy sauce and sugar. Return the pork and
chillies to the wok. Cook for another minute to allow the flavours to mingle.

**5.**  To serve, transfer everything but the sauce onto a large plate.

**6**. Leave sauce on the heat and allow it to reduce slightly, then pour over
the pork. Add extra Sichuan pepper and salt if desired. Serve with steamed
rice or blanched Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.
