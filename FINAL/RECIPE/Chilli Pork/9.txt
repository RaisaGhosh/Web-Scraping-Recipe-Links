# How to make the Ultimate Chilli Pork

## Tender meat, some bhut jolokia and, maybe, Kerala porottas. Sounds like a
plan, doesn‚Äôt it?

This Chilli Pork dish is best paired with Kerala parottas. (Source:
Ooonuready.com)

The Chilli Pork I usually prepare is either the Kerala-style preparation, or
the Chinese-style dish. But, this one is different and rather eclectic. This
recipe makes use of three kinds of chili ‚Äî actually four because the Kashmiri
Chilli lends it its colour. The highlight are the bhut jolokia chillies. One
whiff of these chillies after they have been ground, and you can understand
why the Indian Army used it to develop a ‚Äòchilli‚Äô grenade. This preparation is
simple, and all you need is lots of garlic, ginger and some mustard oil. I
don‚Äôt use garam masala in this preparation and it‚Äôs super spicy. We usually
have this curry with rotis or parathas, but this time we had it with Kerala
Porotta. I think this recipe, if tweaked, will make an awesome pickle recipe,
too.

Note: This dish is not for people who cannot tolerate spicy food. Omit the
bhut jolokia if you can‚Äôt stand the heat. If you don‚Äôt have access to the
chillies, use Tabasco, or Peri Peri. Habanero is a good option, too.
Bird‚Äôs-eye chillies are a good option, but the bhut jolokia gives the dish a
fantastic smoky flavour.

**Method**  
* Pressure-cook the cubed pork with salt, 1 cup water and turmeric up to three whistles.  
* Mince the garlic cloves and ginger using a mortar and pestle. I don‚Äôt like the ginger and garlic ground to a paste, so I ensure I get this done using my mortar and pestle. And it does make a difference to the way the dish tastes.  
* Make a fine paste out of the bhut jolokia chillies and vinegar in a grinder.  
* Add half an onion for this paste, because the small chilies might not grind smoothly otherwise.  
* Heat the mustard oil in a pan and wait till it starts to smoke.  
* Now, add the diced onions. After the onions soften, turn the flame to medium and add the minced ginger and garlic.  
* Saut√© till the garlic is golden and then add the bhut jolokia and onion paste.  
* Saut√© till the onion paste starts browning. Do the saut√©eing over a low flame and add the chilli powder and chilli flakes.  
* Add the cooked pork after 3 minutes of saut√©eing the chillies together.  
* Now, cook the pork with the chillies for 15 minutes.

_**Note:** _Add the stock reserved from cooking the pork for a thick gravy.
Also, if the pork requires more cooking, add the stock and cook the pork
further in the stock. If your pork has cooked perfectly, you need not cook it
for 15 minutes with the spices. The meat I cooked needed 15 more minutes.  
* After 15 minutes, switch off the flame and serve the pork curry with parathas, lemon wedge and onion rings. Squeeze some lemon over the pork ‚Äî this is a must for this pork curry.
