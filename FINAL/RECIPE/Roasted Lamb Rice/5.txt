## Ingredients

  * Whole British lamb shoulder on the bone (about 2kg)
  * 4 garlic cloves, chopped
  * 1 tbsp ground cumin
  * 1 tbsp ground coriander
  * 1 tsp dried mint
  * ½ tsp dried urfa chilli powder (or other dried chilli powder)
  * 4 tbsp date molasses/syrup (from supermarkets and online)
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * 200ml red wine
  * 200ml orange juice
  * 150g fresh/frozen cranberries

**For the rice**

  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * 30g butter
  * 300g basmati rice
  * 600ml hot chicken stock
  * 50g dried cranberries
  * Large handful chopped parsley
  * 30g ready-made crispy fried onions

## Method

  1. Heat the oven to 130°C fan/gas 2. Put the lamb in a large roasting tin. Mix the garlic, spices, date molasses and oil with some seasoning, then rub all over the lamb. Pour in the wine and orange juice, scatter over the cranberries, then cover tightly with foil and roast for 4 hours.
  2. Uncover the tin, turn up the oven to 180ºC/gas 6 and roast for 30 minutes more to reduce the sauce and brown the meat.
  3. Meanwhile, heat the oil and butter in a large saucepan over a medium heat until the butter melts. Add the rice, stirring to coat the grains. Add the hot stock and bring up to a simmer. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, reduce the heat to very low and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside for 10 minutes to allow the grains to plump up fully.
  4. Fluff up the rice with a fork to separate the grains and check the seasoning. Stir in the dried cranberries and most of the parsley and crispy onions, then top with the remaining parsley and crispy onions and serve alongside the lamb.
