# Golden Fried Prawns

Comfort Food, Goodies, Southern Appetizers, Southern Dinners

_Golden fried prawns is the perfect starter dish made with jumbo prawns,
coated with crispy fried batter. Fried prawns or shrimp are a popular seafood
starter in restaurants, and anyone who loves prawns can 't resist this
delectable appetizer._

* * *

This popular Chinese-American dish is a special appetizer to make on New
Year's Eve or for the Lunar New Year. (Maybe make some homemade fortune
cookies too? )

But these crispy batter fried prawns are easy enough to make on _**any day**_
you want to enjoy some delicious fried shrimp.

## Cooking and Serving Golden Fried Prawns

There are various ways to make batter fried jumbo prawns, but popular versions
are the light-battered style and the type served in Chinese restaurants -
mildly spicy golden fried prawns. If you enjoy spiciness, use chili sauce or
chili powder as mentioned in this recipe. For plain golden prawns, just skip
the spices.

Prawns and shrimp are delicate seafood that need gentle care and fast cooking.
Prawns fry quickly. Prolonged cooking on high heat makes them rubbery and
hard. High heat frying or roasting for more than 5 minutes is too much,
evaporates the natural juices of the prawns, making them tough.

Crispy batter fried prawns are perfect when served hot, with **cocktail sauce,
spicy sauce, tartar sauce, soy sauce, ketchup** or the sauce of your choice. A
simple spritz of **lemon juice** also works nicely.

## Prawns or Shrimp…which one to use?

Prawns are comparatively stronger shrimp. Shrimp are delicate to handle.
Prawns get mildly sweet when cooked, more so than shrimp. Prawns are larger
than shrimp, and therefore easier to handle for recipes like Golden Fried
Prawns.

Though they each have unique features, prawns and shrimp are usually
interchangeable in recipes because of their similar taste and texture.

Choose bigger size cleaned, shelled, and de-veined prawns or shrimp for this
recipe. Similar to shrimp, small prawns are too delicate to handle and often
break. I use large king-size prawns for this recipe.

## Cleaning and de-veining prawns:

Rinse the prawns with water to clean. Break the outer shell and insert your
thumbs to peel it open. Pull off the tiny legs. If you wish to leave the tail,
leave the shell on it.

To de-vein prawns or shrimp, rinse them once again in running water. Make a
thin slit from the head towards the tail on its back. You'll see something
that looks like a thin black string. This is the digestive tract of the prawn
and should be removed before cooking. Pull the string with your fingers gently
through the entire length.

These shelled and de-veined prawns are now ready to fry.

## How to Batter Fry Jumbo Prawns

 **Peanut oil** is a nice choice for fried prawn and fried shrimp recipes.
**Vegetable oil** or **canola oil** also work well for frying. That's because
all three of these oils have a high smoke point. Olive oil has a lower smoke
point and is better suited for sautéing.

### Ingredients

  * 24 Prawns or shrimp, jumbo size
  * Oil for frying
  * 3 tbsp all-purpose flour
  * 1 tbsp corn starch
  * 1 tsp salt
  * ¾ tsp sugar
  * 1/8 tsp baking powder
  * 1 egg
  * ½ tsp ground black pepper
  * 1 tsp chili sauce or 1/4 tsp chili powder - optional
  * ¼ cup water (approximately)

## Recipe for Golden Fried Prawns

### Prepping prawns:

Clean the jumbo prawns or shrimp with running water. If you have whole prawns,
read the above section about how to de-shell and devein prawns and shrimp.

Pat the raw shrimp dry with a paper towel to remove the excess water.

### Directions

  1. In a mixing bowl, mix the 3 tbsp of all-purpose flour and 1 tbsp of corn starch. Add in the 1 tsp of salt, 3/4 tsp of sugar, pinch of baking powder, 1 egg, 1/2 tsp of ground pepper, and 1/4 tsp red chili powder. (You can replace the chili powder with 1 tsp of chili sauce, but the chili is a completely optional ingredient.) A dash of garlic powder or turmeric powder could also be used, if you enjoy those flavors.
  2. Mix the egg into the dry ingredients.
  3. Next, add a quarter cup of water and mix until there are no lumps. The batter should be thin and not thick. Adjust the amount of water accordingly.
  4. Heat the oil in a skillet or other deep fry pan to a medium-hot temperature.
  5. Using small tongs to pick up the prawn by the tail, add each prawn one by one into the oil without crowding. Let them fry for a minute. Then gently flip them and fry the other side. Wait until the batter is cooked and bulged and is a light brown color. Remove the golden fried prawns from the oil and let rest on a paper towel. Repeat this step for the rest of the batches. Serve while still hot.

This fried shrimp dish can be served with lemon wedges and dipping sauce as an
appetizer or with egg fried rice or vegetable fried rice to make a really
delicious shrimp fried rice.
