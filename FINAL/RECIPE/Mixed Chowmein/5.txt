## How to Make Chicken Chowmein

HideShow Media

1.

In a large saucepan bring about 5 cups of water, 1 tsp salt and 1 tbsp oil to
a boil.

2.

Note: Add the noodles and let them cook till 'bite like'-- when pressed
between the thumbnail and the forefinger, the cut should be felt through (that
is, it should offer some resistance). If over done, the nail will hardly feel
the texture and if under done, you will need to apply some pressure and the
inside will be whiter.

3.

Drain the water and immediately put the noodles under running cold water, to
stop further cooking, and continue till cool.

4.

Rub the remainder of the 1 tbsp of oil into the noodles and leave in a
colander to drain further. This is best done ahead of time.

5.

Heat the 6 tbsp oil and stir-fry the onions and the garlic over high heat,
till a light brown.

6.

Add the chicken and salt and turn around a few times.

7.

Add the soya sauce, celery, vinegar and chilli sauce and mix well.

8.

Last of all, add the noodles, mix well and serve hot.
