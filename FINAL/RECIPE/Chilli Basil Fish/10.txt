### Method:

1\. **Chilli basil butter:** Put all the ingredients except the butter in a
food processor and chop finely. Add the butter and process until the
ingredients are well combined. Shape into a roll and freeze.

2\. **Tomato salsa:** Mix all the ingredients and place in a jar.

3\. **Fish:** Grease a clean braai grid well with nonstick spray. Put the fish
on the grid, skin side down. Slice the butter and place a generous amount on
the flesh of the fish.

4\. Braai, skin side down high above slow coals (you should be able to keep
your hand over the coals for 10 seconds) until the flesh is white and no
longer glassy. Add more butter as needed and brush the melted butter over the
fish from time to time.

5\. Close the grid and turnover. Brush the flesh with butter and braai for
about two minutes or until slightly seared. Turn and cook briefly again on the
skin side.

6\. Place the fish on a serving plate and spoon the salsa on top.

7\. **To serve:** Serve with braaied mealies and lemon wedges.
