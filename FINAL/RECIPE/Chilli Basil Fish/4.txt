## Ingredients

Serves: 3-4 people

### Main Ingredients

  * 1 whole barramundi (cleaned, pat dried) 
  * ½ cup plain flour 
  * 8 shallots (finely chopped) 
  * 5 cloves garlics (finely chopped) 
  * 8 red chillies (chopped) 
  * 1 red capsicum (chopped) 
  * 1 tsp cornflour (mix with 1 tbsp water) 
  * 1 cup Thai basil leaves (plus extra for garnish) 
  * Cooking oil for deep frying 

### For Sauce

  * ¼ cup stock 
  * ¼ cup fish sauce 
  * 2 tbsp soy sauce 
  * 2 tbsp palm sugar 
  * ½ lime (juiced) 

## Directions

### To Cook

  1. Heat 1 tbsp of oil over medium-high heat in a pot, then sauté the chopped shallots, garlics, red chillies and red capsicums for about 5 mins.
  2. Add in all sauce ingredients and bring to boil. Allow sauce to simmer for approx. 5 mins or until slightly reduced.
  3. Stir in flour solution and let simmer until thickened, about 1 min.
  4. Stir in the Thai basil leaves and cook for another 1 min or until fragrant, then reduce heat to the lowest to keep warm until ready to serve.
  5. Heat oil in a wok to deep fry the whole fish. Coat fish with flour and carefully slide into the hot oil. Deep fry until the side facing down is crispy and browned.
  6. Flip the fish and continue frying until the other side is crispy and browned. Remove fish to a plate lined with paper towels.
  7. Allow excess oil to be soaked and transfer fish to a serving plate. Top the crispy fish with the Thai basil chilli sauce and serve immediately.
