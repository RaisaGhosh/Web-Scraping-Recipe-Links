15 Tasty Snack Ideas for People With Diabetes

####  15 Tasty Snack Ideas for People With Diabetes

When you're managing diabetes, snacks play a key role in keeping your blood
sugar stable. A pantry stash of pre-packaged, carb-loaded snacks full of added
sugar and sodium won't cut it, though. You're much better off noshing on whole
foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains. The
following diabetes-friendly snacks spin nutritious ingredients into delicious,
deceptively healthy snacks. Recipes like plantain chips, peanut butter balls,
roasted chickpeas, and guacamole compete with processed snacks in flavor, and
leave you feeling full.

This may be one of the top recipes I have found on Allrecipes. It is
remarkably uncomplicated, requires no special ingredients or equipment, and
produces a delicious soup that fills the house with happy aromas. The only
minor alteration I made was replacing the farro with barley due to
availability.

I didn't make the cilantro sauce, but it was still very good. Made naan bread
to go with it. I would make it again.

This was something different for our family because I am trying to find
meatless options. My teenage kids won't eat mushrooms but my husband and I
enjoyed the soup. I used 4 cups vegetable broth and 1 cup beef broth (had to
get the meat flavor in there a bit!) I used 2 carrots and might even add more
since I like carrots in soup. I did add the peas and thought they were a nice
touch. I cooked down the wine before adding the broth but I thought the broth
still had too much residual wine flavor for me so might cut back on that some
next time.
