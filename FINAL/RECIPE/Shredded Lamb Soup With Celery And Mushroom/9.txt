## Why is this recipe a winner?

This is recipe that's perfect for weeknight dinners especially, in chilly
weather. The lamb and potatoes go very well together and are flavored with
vegetables such as onion and celery. We love making this delicious easy lamb
stew in big batches and have it through the week.

## Ingredients

To make a delicious lamb and vegetable stew you need the following
ingredients:

  * **Lamb:** lamb shoulder cut into 1 inch pieces work best for this recipe. I prefer to discard the excess fat on the meat. 
  * **Celery** : A few stalks of celery add a lot of flavor to the stew. 
  * **Carrots** : They add just a little bit of sweetness to the dish. 
  * **Potatoes** : Make sure the potato chunks are not too small. 
  * **Onions and garlic** : The more the better! 
  * **Mushrooms** : You can use white button mushrooms or baby bella mushrooms. 
  * **Spices** : Including salt, pepper, bay leaf and turmeric. 
  * **Tomato paste:** Adds color and flavor. 
  * **Beef broth:** To add some deep flavor. You can also use vegetable stock or water. 

Most lamb stews call for wine or beer but this lamb stew recipe is alcohol-
free and tastes fantastic. Try using fresh ingredients as they definitely
boost the flavor of the stew. You can even prepare some of the ingredients in
advance such as chopping the carrots and celery.

## What cut of lamb to use

Lamb shoulder is the best cut to make stews as it is full of flavors because
it's the part that has moved a lot. Lamb shoulder takes longer to cook
therefor it's perfect for stews that need to cook for more time.

## Instructions

  * Start with browning the lamb pieces and set aside. 
  * Saute the vegetables and add the lamb back. Make sure to scrape the brown bits at the bottom of the pot since that's where all the flavor is. 
  * Add all the spices, tomato paste and beef stock to the pot and stir well. 
  * Cover with the lid on and let the stew cook for about two hours until everything is fully cooked and the broth starts to thicken.

> **Kitchen tip:** The key to a delicious lamb stew is fresh ingredients and a
> good amount of spices. Make sure that all the flavors are blended and the
> stew has simmered long enough.

## Slow cooker instructions

  * Saute lamb in some olive oil and transfer it to the slow cooker. 
  * Next, saute the vegetables in the same pot and transfer to the slow cooker.
  * Add in the spices and broth and then cook on high for 4-6 hours or on low for 6-8 hours. 
  * Once cooked, take the lid off and mix two tablespoons of flour with Â½ cup broth and return it to the slow cooker. 
  * Cook for another 30 minutes in high for the broth to thicken.

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I make this stew ahead of time?**

Yes, you can make this recipe beforehand and refrigerate for up to 3 days.
It's best to reheat it in a saucepan over medium heat.

**How can I make this stew spicy?**

To make spicy lamb stew, add Â½ teaspoon cayenne pepper with the other spices
to the stew. Once the stew is ready, taste and add more cayenne pepper if
needed.

**Can I add other vegetables?**

Yes! This lamb stew is so versatile, you can add veggies such as bell peppers,
green beans or butternut squash to this stew for more flavor.

## Serving suggestions

You can serve lamb stew with French or Italian bread. You can also serve it on
white rice, too. This lamb stew recipe is so easy and goes well with any kind
of side even a green salad.

## Notes and tips

  * If beef broth is not available, use vegetable broth or simply water.
  * You can leave out the mushrooms if you don't like to have them in the stew.
  * This stew can easily be frozen and reheated again. To reheat the stew, let it thaw in the fridge and then heat it on medium low in a pot.

This was the perfect winter dinner. Comfort food that wasn't too heavy. The
lamb was incredibly tender and I would happily have the sauce by the spoonful!
