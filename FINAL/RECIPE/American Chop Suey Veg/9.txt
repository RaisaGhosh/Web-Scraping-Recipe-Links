## How to make American Chop Suey Recipe - Crispy Noodles Topped With Sweet
and Sour Vegetables

  1. To begin making the American Chop Suey Recipe, prep all the ingredients and keep ready.

  2. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan and add the noodles to it. Allow the noodles to soften just a bit. As soon as the noodles soften, turn off the heat and drain the water immediately. We want the noodles that are not fully cooked, but have just softened in water. 

  3. Wash the noodles in cold running water and keep aside.

  4. Heat oil for deep frying on medium high heat; once the oil is heated, add in the half cooked noodles in small batches and deep fry them until they turn golden brown and crisp.

  5. Important Note: Ensure when you add oil for deep frying in the kadai or a deep frying pan, there is enough room of about 1-½ inches between the oil and the rim of the pan.

  6. This is because when you add the cooked noodles to the hot oil, it bubbles and rises up to the rim and there is a high chance of the oil overflowing out of the pan. 

  7. Also ensure you add a small batch of noodles at a time to fry, as the noodles sizzles in the oil causing oil to rise and overflow.

  8. Drain the oil from the fried noodles and proceed the same way with the remaining noodles. Keep the crisp noodles aside.

  9. In a mixing bowl, combine the corn flour, chilli sauce, soy sauce, tomato pure, tomato ketchup and vinegar. Stir in 2 or 2-1/2  cups of water and mix well to combine and ensure there are no lumps. Keep aside

  10. Heat oil in a saucepan; add in the garlic, ginger, spring onions and saute for a few seconds till you can smell the aromas coming through. Add the sauce mixture and keep stirring until it thickens. This will take 4 to 5 minutes.

  11. Heat oil in a wok; add the onions and the vegetables, sprinkle salt and pepper and stir fry on high heat until the vegetables are just about cooked. It should feel firm and yet be cooked. 

  12. Once the vegetables are cooked, add in the sauce to it and stir on high heat for a couple of minutes. Turn off the heat and check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.

  13. To serve the American Chop Suey, place the crisp noodles on a serving plate and spoon over the sweet and sour vegetables over the crispy noodles. Serve the American Chopsuey immediately.

  14. Note: You can also use a combination of both crisp noodles and soft noodles, the choice is purely yours on how you would like to serve your American Chop Suey.

  15. Serve the American Chop Suey along with a Sweet Corn Vegetable Soup and  Crispy Banana Fritters for a delicious Indo Chinese Dinner.
