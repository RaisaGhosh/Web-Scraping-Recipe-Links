###  Ingredients

  * **2 kg** chicken wings, cut into mid wing and drumettes
  * Vegetable oil, for deep - frying 
  * **500 g** rice flour
  * Sriracha sauce, to serve

**Marinade**

  * **10** garlic cloves, finely chopped
  * **2 -3 cm** piece ginger, peeled and grated
  * **½ bunch** spring onions, thinly sliced
  * **250 ml** (1 cup) oyster sauce 
  * **250 ml** (1 cup) light soy sauce
  * **50 ml** fish sauce
  * **100 g** sugar
  * Murray river pink salt and ground black pepper, to taste

### Cook's notes

Oven temperatures are for conventional; if using fan-forced (convection),
reduce the temperature by 20˚C. | We use Australian tablespoons and cups: 1
teaspoon equals 5 ml; 1 tablespoon equals 20 ml; 1 cup equals 250 ml. | All
herbs are fresh (unless specified) and cups are lightly packed. | All
vegetables are medium size and peeled, unless specified. | All eggs are 55-60
g, unless specified.

### Instructions

**Marinating time:** 3 hours

  1. Place all the marinade ingredients in a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the chicken wings, toss to coat well, then cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
  2. Fill a large heavy-based saucepan one third full of vegetable oil and heat to 180˚C.
  3. Place the rice flour in a large bowl. Take the chicken wings out of the marinade, add to the rice flour and toss to coat. Stand for 5 minutes.
  4. Fry the chicken wings in batches until golden and crisp. Drain on a wire rack and season with a little salt. Serve immediately with Sriracha sauce on the side.
