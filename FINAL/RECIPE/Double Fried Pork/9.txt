**Twice-cooked pork** or **double-cooked pork** (Chinese: 回鍋肉; pinyin:
_huíguōròu_ ) (literally "returned to the pan (wok)") is a Chinese dish in
Sichuan cuisine. The pork is simmered, sliced, and then stir-fried --
"returned to the wok." The pork is accompanied with stir-fried vegetables,
most commonly leeks, but often cabbage, bell peppers, onions, or scallions.
The sauce may include Shaoxing rice wine, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sugar,
ginger, chili bean paste, and tianmianjiang bean paste.[1][2]

This dish is commonly associated with _yan jian rou_ (Chinese: 鹽煎肉; lit.
'salted fried pork'), which tastes quite similar, but cooked in a different
process.

## Preparation[edit]

Japanese style

The process of cooking twice-cooked pork involves first simmering pork belly
steaks in water with spices, such as ginger, cloves, star anise, jujubes, or
salt. After refrigeration to firm the meat, it is cut into thin slices.The
pork is then returned to a wok and shallow fried in oil, usually along with
some vegetables. The most commonly used vegetables are garlic leaves, napa
cabbage, bell peppers, and scallions.[2]

Another simple way of preparing this dish is to cook the meat by itself until
it is done, then fry it along with the other ingredients. An alternative
method involves frying the meat by itself until cooked, frying the vegetables
separately, then frying everything together. This approach of frying the pork
twice led to the name "twice-cooked pork".

Premade twice-cooked pork sauces are also available from food manufacturers.

## History[edit]

The origins of twice-cooked pork are unknown.

The Sichuan people have a tradition of enjoying a feast every 1st and 15th of
traditional Chinese calendar months, with twice-cooked pork as the main
course.[ _citation needed_ ]
