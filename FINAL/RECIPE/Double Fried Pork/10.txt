## What Is Twice-Cooked Pork?

Twice-cooked pork is inspired by _Sichuan flavors_ and originally comes from
the Sichuan region of China, which is why it‚Äôs so spicy. The Sichuan region is
known for being humid and lush, an environment that produces many hot peppers
and chilis, including the tribute pepper, Sichuan pepper, and Erjingtiao
chili. These peppers are said to be hot enough to numb the lips and tongue, so
you can continue to eat more of them.

As the name would indicate, twice-cooked pork is a pork dish that undergoes
two unique cooking processes: simmering and then stir-frying. The Chinese name
Hu√≠ Gu≈ç R√≤u roughly translates to ‚Äúmeat returned to dish.‚Äù In addition to the
pork, the flavors from twice-cooked pork come from vegetables like cabbage,
peppers, and onions and ingredients like bean paste, hoisin sauce, soy sauce,
and ginger.

Twice-cooked pork also has _a spiritual and celebratory place_ in Chinese
culture. It is often shared at the start and mid-point of lunar months in the
Sichuan region and represents an offering to the ancestors. The rich and
flavorful taste is meant to remind them of their lives, and after the ceremony
is observed, the food is then consumed by the diners in attendance.  

## History of Twice-Cooked Pork

Like many Chinese food dishes, there is a great amount of speculation
surrounding the origin of twice-cooked pork. The bold and spicy flavors
indicate that it originated in the Sichuan region of China, and one of the
most common stories behind the unique method of preparation is related to its
role as an offering for the gods or ancestors.

Families of wealth would make sacrifices of meat to the gods, but those with
fewer resources would not be able to make the same sacrifice. Instead, they
would use cheaper cuts of meat and boil them until to fit. After they have
been used as a sacrifice, the cheaper meat, which was usually pork, was then
cooked again, along with spices and vegetables, and served to those in the
household.

Since then, many variations of this dish have evolved, and it continues to be
a favorite dish both in China and to those lucky enough to try it around the
world‚Äîand you can begin making it in your own kitchen today.  

## Make Twice-Cooked Pork at Home

When you‚Äôre ready to begin making twice-cooked pork at home, Fly By Jing has
you covered with the ingredients you‚Äôll need and recipes that you‚Äôre sure to
enjoy from the very first bite. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll want to know about cooking
twice-cooked pork for your next celebration with friends and family.

### Ingredients

The ingredients you use in this dish can play a large role in how hot it
tastes and which flavors stand out most. Here are the essential ingredients
for your home-cooked twice-cooked pork.

**For the Mea**

 **1 Pound Slab of Pork Belly** : For this classic Sichuan dish, the star of
the show is pork belly. You want a nice fatty whole slab, about 60% meat and
40% fat.

 **Sliced Ginger:** Many Chinese food dishes employ the use of ginger to boost
and balance the other flavors. Have a few slices of ginger on hand and adjust
accordingly.

**2-3 Scallions:** Separate your scallion whites from your greens and set
aside. Long pieces are fine.

**1 Medium Leek:** Cut leek into thin strips about 2 inches long and set
aside.

**For the Sauce**

 **1 Tablespoon Doubanjiang** : _Doubanjiang_ is a fermented bean paste from
the Sichuan region. It is traditionally fermented for three years and adds a
savory and umami flavor to every dish. It is often referred to as the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù
of Sichuan cooking.

**1 Tablespoon Sichuan Chili Crisp:** Sichuan chili crisp is one of those
essential ingredients that any Chinese food home cook will want to have close
at hand. It‚Äôs derived from Sichuan peppers and is said to be spicy enough to
numb the tongue so you can continue eating more.

**1 Tablespoon Tianmianjiang (Sweet Bean Paste):** If doubanjiang offers up
savory and umami flavors, _tianmianjiang_ adds a touch of sweetness you won‚Äôt
be able to resist, though it does have hints of salt and umami flavoring as
well. Though the name might indicate otherwise, the primary ingredient in
sweet bean paste is actually wheat, so adjust your dish to account for any
gluten allergies.

**1 Tablespoon Light Soy Sauce** : Light soy sauce is used in many Chinese
food dishes, and it also serves as a drizzle or sauce for dipping. It differs
from dark soy sauce, so be sure you have the right ingredient on hand.

**1 Tablespoon Sugar or Honey** : Twice-cooked pork does have a sweet flavor
profile, and you can adjust it to fit your preferred sweetness level. Use a
touch of honey or sugar to help achieve that signature sweetness.

**1 Tablespoon Fermented Black Beans:** Fermented black beans are also called
douchi. Unlike some of the other bean ingredients, they don‚Äôt form a paste.
Instead, they are individual beans with a slight coating of salt that adds a
savory and rich umami flavor to your dish.

### Recipe

Twice-cooked pork takes time and cannot be done in a hurry, so set aside the
hours you need to ensure it goes through each part of the cooking process
properly. Prepare the pork by boiling and cooling it a few hours beforehand.

**Step One:** Bring a pot of water to boil and add the slab of pork belly with
ginger and scallion whites. Simmer until cooked through, about 15-20 minutes.
Remove the pork and discard the rest.

 **Step Two:** Let the pork cool and then rest in the refrigerator until the
meat is thoroughly cooled and firm (at least a couple of hours.) This step is
important because it will make the meat easier to slice.

**Step Three:** When ready, use a sharp knife or cleaver and cut the pork
belly into slices as thin as you can, starting from the skin side down. Pat
dry and set aside until ready to fry.

**Step Four:** Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok until very hot. Add pork
belly slices and fry until they start to take on a little bit of color. Push
the pork up to the side of the wok or pan.

**Step Five:** Still on high heat, add doubanjiang and _Sichuan Chili Crisp_
to the pan, fry until fragrant.

 **Step Six:** Add the rest of the sauce components and mix the pork belly
back in, making sure the meat is well-coated. Add leek segments in last and
fry until they are softened but still green in color.

**Step Seven:** Serve Immediately over white rice. ****

## Conclusion

Twice-cooked pork may be a slightly more challenging and time-consuming dish
to put together than some of the other stir-fries in Chinese home cooking, but
it‚Äôs always worth it. Not only does it have a rich and important cultural
history, but it‚Äôs also cooked with some of the most delicious, bold, and
filling flavors and ingredients that you‚Äôll find at a Chinese restaurant or in
your own home.

flavors and to balance them with a touch of sweetness and umami that makes
