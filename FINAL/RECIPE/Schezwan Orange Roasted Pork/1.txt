Szechuan Orange Pork

Early Summer 2001

By: Lucy Waverman

Spicy but sweet with orange, this is a superb Chinese main course to serve
with rice and stir-fried vegetables. Chicken, cubes of beef tenderloin or
shrimp may be used instead of pork.

Serves 4

* * *

1 lb (500 g) pork tenderloin  
1 egg white  
1 tbsp (15 mL) cornstarch  
1 tbsp (15 mL) water  
1 tbsp (15 mL) soy sauce  
  
 **Seasoning Sauce:**  
2 tbsp (25 mL) hoisin sauce  
1 tsp (5 mL) Asian chilli sauce  
2 tbsp (25 mL) soy sauce  
3 tbsp (45 mL) orange juice  
1/4 cup (50 mL) triple sec  
1 tsp (5 mL) sugar  
  
 **To finish**  
3 tbsp (45 mL) vegetable oil  
2 tbsp (25 mL) julienned orange peel  
1 tsp (15 mL) minced garlic  
1 tbsp (15 mL) minced ginger  
1/2 green pepper, cubed  
1/2 red pepper, cubed  
1 tsp (5 mL) cornstarch  
1 tbsp (15 mL) water

1\. Cut pork into 1/2-inch (1-cm) dice. Place in bowl. Combine marinade
ingredients and stir with pork.  
  
2\. Stir together seasoning sauce ingredients and reserve.  
  
3\. Heat 2 tbsp (25 mL) oil in wok on high heat. Drain pork and add to wok.
Stir fry until just pink inside, about three minutes. Remove from wok and
reserve. Wipe out wok.  
  
4\. Add remaining oil to wok. Stir fry orange peel for 30 seconds, then add
garlic and ginger. Stir together. Add peppers and stir fry until peppers are
browned and softened, about two minutes.  
  
5\. Return pork and any juices, add seasoning sauce and bring to boil. Stir
together water and cornstarch and drizzle into wok, stirring. Bring to boil,
stirring until sauce thickens. Serve immediately.
