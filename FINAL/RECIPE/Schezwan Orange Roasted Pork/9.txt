# Crunchy Szechuan (or Sichuan) Pork

_Spicy and wonderfully flavored, this Szechuan (or Sichuan) pork comes
together fast and is **great for weekday meals**. With crunchy carrots, ginger
and orange juice, you can have it **ready in 30 minutes!**_

Steps for making this recipe.

Crunchy Szechuan Pork and Carrots

Ingredients

Trying to get out of my flavor comfort zone, I decided to make this Szechuan
Pork. Or Sichuan pork as this flavorful spice is also written.

I order take-out a lot, mostly Chinese, so an Asian dish made in the wok
fitted right into my weekday dinner ideas. Easy, fast and super flavorful!

## What are Szechuan or Sichuan peppercorns?

It is **a spice** originating from the same-name province in China _(image
above)_.

It is **very unique in flavor** as it creates a sort of numbness after a
while. That sensation is unfamiliar but it adds a quality, unlike other
peppers.

It is spicy but different than hot peppers, fragrant and **sort of citrusy
sometimes**. Very, very unique.

I have to say that my first time eating Szechuan or Sichuan peppercorns **I'm
hooked**.

## Preparing the pork.

I love to coat the bite-sized pork pieces with **a cornmeal mixture** before
adding them to the wok _(image above)_.

This adds crunchiness to each bite.

  * _**Lightly toasting the peppercorns:**_ heat opens the flavors of spices, so this step allows for a deeper Szechuan flavor. 

##

## Steps for making this recipe.

  * Heat the wok over medium/high heat. 
  * Add a tablespoon of oil (not to the bottom but in a circular motion at the top of the wok walls. That way the oil will reach the bottom of the wok hot. 
  * Add the pork pieces and lightly cook until lightly seared or sauteed. Some pink parts might remain _(image above)_. Transfer to a bowl and reserve.
  * Add the carrots and leek to the same wok _(image below)_ and cook until lightly softened about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and reserve.

  * Add garlic, ginger and rest of ingredients (except for rice) and cook until softened and soy sauce is somewhat reduced.
  * Add pork pieces and carrots back again to the wok and cook until no pink remains in the meat and the carrots are crunchy but soft enough to eat.

This is the kind of wok recipe that comes together fairly quickly, even though
there is chopping and a reasonable list of ingredients involved. In my case I
have all of them usually in my pantry and my fridge.

While the rice was cooking I made the pork.

And since recipes are at least for 2, I now have an effortless dinner at hand.
I wonder what the Chinese restaurant will think of my absence. I'll worry
about it while enjoying this sweet and spicy szechuan pork and carrots.

  8. Add ginger and garlic to the wok, saute 1 minute and add soy sauce, honey, orange juice and mirin. Cook until sauce is somewhat syrupy.

  11. Add pork mixture on top, dividing evenly.

_When using a wok always add oil or liquids around the edges, so they reach
the middle already hot._

This looks delicious, Paula. Cornmeal is an inventive way to add crunch - I
never think of using it in Asian inspired dishes, but why not? ðŸ™‚

Good for you for steering away from an all-sweets diet --- that's so "big
girl" of you. I like this. It sounds delicious. And, I always like to be able
to squeeze an extra meal or two out of something I make. I really enjoyed
reading this Post, Paula. This was a good sentence - "This pork recipe had
been on my mind for a week now, so it was time to ditch the chinese rice and
prepare something as good as the day promised to be. And the night had already
been." and definitely a positive thought. Glad you are having fun with old
friends but what are you doing out until 4am, Girl? I actually envy you that
you can.

Well, you know how dinner here is no earlier than 9pm, especially when thereÂ´s
a large group involved. So I came back home at 4am...it was soooo much fun!

Paula - I am so glad to see this recipe as I have been craving Chinese lately
and like to make it myself. AND, as I usually use chicken, i needed a change
and pork is the perfect choice. I agree with you - all else pales in
comparison to time with friends and out families of choice but ,if you can
combine them, there is nothing better! Thanks! ~David
