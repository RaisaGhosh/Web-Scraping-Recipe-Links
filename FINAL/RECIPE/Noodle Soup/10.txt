Total disaster! I made it for the the dinner & followed every step but
unfortunately it turned out to be tasteless and I felt like I was eating raw
noodles just boiled with some water. No flavour. No colour. No taste.

Tarla Dalal    Hi Miinu, You can add more flavours and spices if you wish to.
We have added less amount of spices as kids usually prefer less-spicy food.
