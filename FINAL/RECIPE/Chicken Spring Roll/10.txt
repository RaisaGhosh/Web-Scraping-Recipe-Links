**Chicken spring rolls** might look modest and mild on the outside. But the
adage “never judge a book by its cover”, holds particularly true for this
dish; for what lies inside is a fiery, tangy, and ridiculous tasty filling!

This recipe takes around 30 minutes to prepare and 15 minutes to cook.
Therefore, you may want to start preparing earlier than you expect your kids
to return from school. Ingredients to make **chicken spring rolls** are
affordable and easily available in local stores.

 **Health Benefits** :

 **Chicken spring rolls** , when shallow-fried, carry plenty of health
benefits. Cabbage, a cruciferous vegetable, is rich in vitamin C. It also
balances hormones, and keeps body weight in check. Carrots are rich in vitamin
A. Hot pepper sauce contains peppers, which boost metabolism and detoxifies
the body!

#### How to make Chicken Spring Rolls

  * In a medium-sized bowl, mix chicken, onion, cabbage, carrot, barbeque sauce, hot pepper sauce, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.
  * Place a handful of chicken mix in a spring roll wrapper and seal filling with a few drops of water.
  * Heat a heavy pan over high flame and pour oil.
  * Deep-fry 2 rolls at a time until golden brown.
  * Place the fried rolls on a paper towel to remove excess oil.

Note: If you want to avoid deep-frying, you can saute ingredients that make up
the filling (until completely cooked), transfer filling into spring roll
wrappers, and shallow fry using a few tablespoons of oil.

You can also wrap **chicken spring rolls** using aluminium foil to keep them
moist. You can also pack a few hot spring rolls in modern, smart and compact
**Vaya tiffin boxes** for your kids.

 **Trivia** :

  * While you may wonder, when spring rolls have nothing to do with a spring or don't even closely resemble one, where the snack gets its name from!

In ancient China, seasoned vegetables wrapped in thin dough were during the
spring season, and that's how spring rolls were born!

Spring rolls take many names in various languages-- _harumaki_ in Japanese,
_popiah in_ Malay, _chungwon_ in South Korean, and so on.
