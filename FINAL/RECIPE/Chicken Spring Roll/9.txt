#### 5 Method Steps

  * Step 1

Combine the mince, spring onion, ginger, garlic and Chinese five spice in a
bowl.

  * Step 2

Place 1 spring roll pastry sheet on a work surface. Place 2 tablespoons of the
mince mixture diagonally across 1 corner. Top with a little wombok and carrot.
Brush opposite corner with water. Fold in sides and roll up to enclose
filling. Repeat with remaining pastry sheets, mince mixture, wombok and
carrot.

  * Step 3

Half-fill a large saucepan with oil. Heat to 180Â°C over medium-high heat (when
oil is ready, a cube of bread turns brown in 15 secs). Cook rolls, in batches,
for 5 mins or until golden and cooked through. Use a slotted spoon to transfer
to a plate lined with paper towel.

  * Step 4

Meanwhile, stir the sauce and 2 tablespoon water in a small saucepan over
medium heat until heated through. Transfer to a serving bowl.

  * Step 5

Sprinkle sauce with chilli, if using, and extra spring onion. Serve with
rolls.
