# Vegan Thai Red Curry

_This Vegan Thai Red Curry has the most flavorful, creamy sauce and is totally
customizable depending on what vegetables you have on hand. Ready in about 30
minutes._

**Is there anything more cozy than a big bowl of curry?**

This recipe is inspired by all the wonderful authentic Thai curries I've
enjoyed, but it is certainly not authentic and uses a store bought curry
paste.

The sauce is to die for. And it's quite simple to make! You can make all sorts
of substitutions in this curry depending on what you have on hand.

  * Serve over noodles, brown rice or white rice
  * Use a mix of frozen and fresh vegetables
  * Purchase some pre-chopped vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, peppers or carrots
  * Add some baked or fried tofu, or tempeh

**Another bonus -** It freezes well! I usually end up freezing some of the
leftovers for quick future lunches.

## How to make Vegan Thai Red Curry

Have everything ready before you start. Chop all your veggies and start your
rice cooking.

  1. SautÃ© the chopped onion in a large pan for a few minutes.
  2. Add bell peppers, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower. Cook for 2-3 minutes.
  3. Now add the curry paste (<-- this is the one I use and love), coconut milk and water. Stir.
  4. Stir in the kale or spinach. Bring to a boil, then simmer mixture, covered, for 5-10 minutes.



Finally, stir in the diced tomatoes, maple syrup, soy sauce and fresh lime
juice. Remove from heat. Serve immediately over rice (or noodles) with fresh
basil or cilantro and hot sauce, if desired.

### Instructions

  * First, prepare all of the vegetables and have them close by before you heat the pan. To make the recipe easier, purchase pre-chopped vegetables or frozen. Cook your rice according to package instructions.

  * Heat 1-2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Once it's warm, add the chopped onion and cook, stirring often, until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds.

  * Now add the bell peppers, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, for about 2-3 minutes. 

  * To the pan, add the red curry paste, coconut milk, and water. Stir well for a few minutes, until the curry paste is dissolved in the coconut milk/water. Now add the kale or spinach and stir it in. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and cook covered for 5-10 minutes, until the vegetables have softened. 

  * Stir in the chopped tomatoes, pure maple syrup, soy sauce and fresh lime juice. Remove from heat.

  * Serve immediately with cooked rice and optional Sriracha and fresh basil/cilantro if desired. Enjoy!

### Notes

  1. You can use many different vegetables in this curry. Switch it up with zucchini, brussels sprouts, or make it easier by using frozen mixed vegetables such as broccoli-cauliflower-carrot mix. Use what you have on hand.
  2. You could also add a protein such as tofu or tempeh. I would stir fry them separately first, then add to the final mix.
  3. I love this Thai Kitchen brand of red curry paste. Look for it or another like it in the Asian section of most grocery stores.
  4. You can use light canned coconut milk if you prefer, it just won't be nearly as creamy.
  5. Nutrition facts do not include rice, only the curry.

Delicious but I agree with others, it's too watery. Maybe that's just personal
preference but I made a cornstarch slurry and that helped a bit. I think some
of it comes from condensation on the lid of the pan. If I made it again, I
would omit the extra water and try my best to not get any condensation into
the pan.

  2. **Linda Atkinson** -- July 19, 2022 @ 8:23 am  Reply

Just made this for lunch and it was delicious! A great way to use the fresh
garden veggies in my fridge. Peas, carrots, snap peas, broccoli, cauliflower,
peppers, you can throw in whatever you have. I threw in a jalapeno (seeded and
cored) because I had one, and after reading the comments I omitted the water.
The sauce thickened nicely and the flavour was great. It took me almost an
hour from start to finish, but it was worth it as I have leftovers to reheat.
I served it over brown rice ramen, but I could have omitted the noodles
easily. This will go in my rotation for work lunches.

Hi Linda. Thank you for taking time to share your wonderful review and
feedback! Your curry sounds really delicious!

What is the serving size?

  4. **Kat** -- May 5, 2022 @ 9:56 pm  Reply

Can't wait to make this! Is there a way to convert this recipe for the instant
pot? Thanks for your great recipes! You are very appreciated!

    * **Nora** -- May 6, 2022 @ 1:31 pm  Reply

You're so welcome, Kat! I haven't tried making this in the Instant Pot but I'm
sure it can be done. It shouldn't take long either!

  5. **Kate** -- May 3, 2022 @ 4:23 pm  Reply

The flavors were good, but the consistency was more watery and less creamy
than I expected. I might try it again and omit the water.

  6. **Diana** -- February 27, 2022 @ 4:56 pm  Reply

I made this last night, and it tasted amazing! I omitted the kale and tomatoes
at the end. I also water sauteed the onion instead of using oil. And I cut the
water down to 1/4 cup.

I'm so glad that you loved the curry, Diana! Thank you for sharing your great
review and feedback! Wishing you happy cooking!

One of my favorite recipes!! So versatile you can use whatever veggies you
have. I usually add extra curry paste and a jalapeÃ±o for extra heat. Also I
leave out the extra water, as we like it on the creamy side. Weâ€™ve made this
several times now and it never disappoints. So good.

  9. **Leigh** -- January 9, 2022 @ 12:49 pm  Reply

This was so delish. A few adjustments:

Marinara instead of tomatoes cause thatâ€™s what I had; coconut sugar instead of
maple syrup; 2 tsp turmeric; frozen peas at the end and 1 T of arrowroot to
thicken it. Served it over jovial cassava orzo and it was perfection.

  10. **Foodieforpeace** -- November 5, 2021 @ 4:37 pm  Reply

We liked the flavors but felt it was more broth than we preferred. Made a
cornstarch slurry which gave it a bit more body. Added browned extra firm tofu
to make it a full meal deal.

  11. **Liz** -- September 26, 2021 @ 8:18 pm  Reply

Iâ€™ve made this 2 times so far and itâ€™s been fabulous both times. I love that I
can use whatever vegetables that I have on hand! I used a bit more curry paste
than the recipe calls for but I think thatâ€™s personal preference. We served
ours over ramen noodles; delish!

    * **Liz** -- September 26, 2021 @ 8:19 pm  Reply

I forgot that I do add about 1-2 cups veggie broth depending on how many
vegetables Iâ€™ve thrown in so that I have enough broth.

I'm so glad you are enjoyed the curry, thanks for sharing!

  12. **RB** -- August 10, 2021 @ 7:15 am  Reply

Been meaning to share this review for the longest time now!

This is our absolute favourite. So much so, that we will have it at least
every second or every third week during winter! ðŸ™‚ Love adding mushrooms to the
mix.  
Some spring onion and coriander towards the end of cooking adds a nice little
lift! However, the recipe as is, is absolutely delicious!!

Thankyou Nora

Thank you for sharing your wonderful review and comments! I'm glad you love
the curry, and thrilled you have added it to your meal rotation!

Can you sub soy milk or will it ruin the recipe? Thanks.

    * **Nora** -- July 27, 2021 @ 6:40 am  Reply

You could, it just won't be as rich and may have a little soy milk taste to
it. Canned coconut milk is much more rich and creamy.

  14. **Madeline** -- July 7, 2021 @ 10:50 am  Reply

I love this recipe! Yesterday was probably my fourth time making it. I am not
a big fan of maple syrup, so I used coconut sugar instead. I also added a
jalapeno pepper because I like spicy food.  
I've had to use 2 cans of coconut milk each time I've made this, otherwise it
isn't really soupy at all. Nora, do you know why this might be?

    * **Nora** -- July 8, 2021 @ 7:01 am  Reply

I'm glad you are enjoying the recipe! You can use more coconut milk if you
want it to be quite thin and soupy, but it's not meant to be a soup, but a
thicker curry to go over rice. But it's fine to adjust it to your preferences.
Thanks!

I have been vegan for 10 weeks now and eaten a lot of veggies, this was my
first curry and wow, sooo tasty, I had it with rice and naan bread and I put
this meal to the top of my favourite meal list ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤

    * **Nora** -- June 26, 2021 @ 8:28 am  Reply

Thank you so much, that is wonderful to hear! This is one of my all time
favorite things to eat.

This looks delicious and canâ€™t wait to try! Caution to Sheilaâ€¦â€¦very few naans
are vegan. ðŸ™‚ the struggle is real!
