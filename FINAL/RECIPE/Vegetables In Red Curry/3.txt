# Thai Red Curry with Vegetables

2,298 Comments

Jump to Recipe

You know dinner was good when you want to eat it for breakfast. Speaking of,
it’s 10 am and I’m writing with a happy belly.

This Thai red curry made a fantastic meal last night and perhaps an even
better breakfast this morning. It’s warm, comforting, and perfect for cool
days. It’s a little rich, too, but so full of vegetables that it doesn’t feel
too indulgent.

I’ve been meaning to try a red Thai curry based on my green curry for a while
now, and I’m so glad I finally did. **It 's the best curry I’ve ever had**,
restaurant versions included! Yeah, I said it.

Bonus? You should be able to find everything you need for this simple curry at
a well-stocked grocery store.

### Watch How to Make Thai Red Curry

## Thai Red Curry Tips

  * The secret to making amazing Thai curries is to use plenty of aromatics, like onion, ginger and garlic.
  * Choose full-fat coconut milk for its richness (you won’t regret it!).
  * Stirring in just a little bit of rice vinegar and sugar adds _tons_ of complexity.
  * Readily available store-bought Thai red curry paste adds characteristic Thai flavor and, bonus, the Thai Kitchen brand is vegetarian. You can make your own if you’re so inclined, though.
  * Feel free to change up the vegetables, as long as you slice them so they're all pretty small and about the same size. You could try broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, diced butternut or sweet potato (which will probably require a longer cooking time), sliced zucchini and/or yellow squash.

**Please let me know how this recipe turns out for you in the comments.** I
love to hear from you.

If you enjoy this hearty dinner recipe, be sure to check out my cookbook for

This Thai red curry recipe is so easy to make at home! It's much tastier than
takeout and healthier, too. Feel free to change up the vegetables (you'll need
about 3 cups total) and skip the kale if you want a more traditional Thai
curry. This recipe is vegetarian, vegan and gluten free for all to enjoy.
Recipe yields 4 servings.

Scale 1x2x3x

### Ingredients

  * 1 ¼ cups brown jasmine rice or long-grain brown rice, rinsed
  * 1 tablespoon coconut oil or olive oil
  * 1 small white onion, chopped (about 1 cup)
  * Pinch of salt, more to taste
  * 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger (about a 1-inch nub of ginger)
  * 2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
  * 1 red bell pepper, sliced into thin 2-inch long strips
  * 1 yellow, orange or green bell pepper, sliced into thin 2-inch long strips
  * 3 carrots, peeled and sliced on the diagonal into ¼-inch thick rounds (about 1 cup)
  * 2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste*
  * 1 can (14 ounces) regular coconut milk**
  * ½ cup water
  * 1 ½ cups packed thinly sliced kale (tough ribs removed first), preferably the Tuscan/lacinato/dinosaur variety
  * 1 ½ teaspoons coconut sugar or turbinado (raw) sugar or brown sugar
  * 1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce***
  * 2 teaspoons rice vinegar or fresh lime juice
  * Garnishes/sides: handful of chopped fresh basil or cilantro, optional red pepper flakes, optional sriracha or chili garlic sauce

### Instructions

  1. To cook the rice, bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the rinsed rice and continue boiling for 30 minutes, reducing heat as necessary to prevent overflow. Remove from heat, drain the rice and return the rice to pot. Cover and let the rice rest for 10 minutes or longer, until you're ready to serve. Just before serving, season the rice to taste with salt and fluff it with a fork.
  2. To make the curry, warm a large skillet with deep sides over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the oil. Add the onion and a sprinkle of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds, while stirring continuously.
  3. Add the bell peppers and carrots. Cook until the bell peppers are fork-tender, 3 to 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the curry paste and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes.
  4. Add the coconut milk, water, kale and sugar, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the peppers, carrots and kale have softened to your liking, about 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  5. Remove the pot from the heat and season with tamari and rice vinegar. Add salt (I added ¼ teaspoon for optimal flavor), to taste. If the curry needs a little more punch, add ½ teaspoon more tamari, or for more acidity, add ½ teaspoon more rice vinegar. Divide rice and curry into bowls and garnish with chopped cilantro and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, if you'd like. If you love spicy curries, serve with sriracha or chili garlic sauce on the side.

### Notes

_Recipe adapted from myThai green curry recipe._  
***Red Thai curry paste:** Look for it in the Asian section of the grocery
store. I like Thai Kitchen brand, which is vegetarian. Not all brands are
(they can contain fish sauce and/or shrimp paste).  
****Coconut milk:** For rich and creamy curry, you need to use regular (not
light/reduced fat) coconut milk that contains guar gum. My favorite is Native
Forest Classic. The varieties without guar gum (which are becoming more widely
available) aren't nearly as creamy, even though their fat content is the same.  
*****Make it gluten free:** Be sure to use gluten-free tamari instead of
regular soy sauce.  
**If you want to add tofu:** I'd suggest baking it first and adding it with
the coconut milk in step 4. If you add raw tofu, it will soak up too much of
the liquid, and baking it greatly improves the texture, anyway.  
**Update 8/10/2016:** I tweaked this recipe a tiny bit to make it richer and
more flavorful (decreased water from ¾ cup to ½ cup, and increased tamari to 1
tablespoon and vinegar to 2 teaspoons). I also updated the post with better
photos!  
**If you love this recipe:** Be sure to check out my other Thai-inspired
recipes here! Don't miss the Thai pineapple fried rice.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I used broccoli - didn't have carrots on
hand. The broccoli soaked up all the Thai flavors. So good!! Could eat the red
Thai coconut sauce like a soup, it was so flavorful!

This is soo delicious!! This recipe was shared with me and what my friend said
was she makes it as a curry but also a soup! I’ve done the soup version twice
now and it is incredible!!  
We start with the onions, salt and sauté that like you say. Then add the
ginger and garlic and the red curry and sauté all that. Then we pour in broth
(we aren’t vegetarian so we do chicken but veggie would work super too) and
let that simmer a while. We sometimes add shredded chicken in now, and I added
potatoes here too. Then after a bit of a simmer I add in the peppers (and
bamboo shoots because I love them), coconut milk, and wait til the peppers are
soft then add the rice vinegar, sugar and soy sauce. It’s incredible thank you
so much!

P.s. we eat a bowl of soup with rice noodles (cooked separately) and they go
soo well with it. And then the garnishes you mention on top!!

in pineapple and shrimp (wasn’t going for vegetarian). Will definitely make it
again!!! It was perfection except for the spice level.

The recipe is good. I doubled the curry paste, increased ginger by 1-1/2. I
added the kale after adding the garlic. To insure it would be more tender and
the other veggies wouldn't over cook. I added a 1/4 cup vegetable broth
instead of water. Then finished with the mixture with rice vinegar.

This was great! I used eggplant along with carrots and bell peppers and was
excellent. Using full fat coconut milk I think is key + it’s very filling so
was totally fine without adding meat.

I love this recipe so simple and delicious I always add tofu as well, I use
firm tofu and cut into cubes and cook in a hot pan until crisp and golden on
the outside I then remove from the pan, follow the recipe for the rest of the
dish and then add the tofu back as suggested in the notes.  
I’ve made this so many times with different vegetables and it’s just so
consistently good, I’m in AustraliaI buy Five Tastes Curry Pastes which are
vegan friendly.  
Tonight I used snow peas, baby corn, broccoli, cauliflower, red capsicum and
red onion.  
Every time I cook this I can’t wait to eat it again the following day.

Thanks. Found this recipe via google search and happy to make your
acquaintance!  
Made the recipe with Jackfruit, my first time using it. Not pleased! I think
I'll try tofu next. I microwaved the carrots, which then turned out too soft.
Will add tofu next, baked as we usually do, and chili-garlic sauce too.  
First time making a recipe is always an experiment.  
Give cookie a scratch behind the ears for me!

This recipe was really delicious. I found it a bit too sweet, so will likely
omit the sugar next time. I used lime juice and subbed the kale with spinach,
which I wilted in the curry at the very end. Also added dried chiles because
the spicier the better (added some chile garlic sauce on top… POW!). Added
seitan, which I made for the first time and boy was it delicious in this dish.
Thanks for the great recipe. It's a keeper!

Splendid curry! thank you. I didn't have kale so used potato,  
peppers, smoked salmon (yum), onion, lots of ginger, etc.  
Had to add more salt - and did not add sugar due to  
my diet. Yet, it was truly wonderful….no pix…ate it all before I remembered..

Hello, I see many people asking about how to freeze this.  
I have not tried this recipe yet, however, I generally pour the leftovers into
freezer bags with the rice mixed in and it is perfect when I defrost it.  
Thanks.

This is delicious but there's no way those carrots are going to be fork tender
in just three to four minutes, so I put a lid on the frying pan and leave them
for at least ten. I've made this a number of times and I've always had to do
that.

Hadn't made this for a while, but local onions, aruba peppers (like bell
peppers in heat but thinner skinned), and kale were all fresh at the local
farm market. What a treat. The panang one with the crispy tofu is next. Thanks
for the recipe.

Awesome! Added some chicken. But otherwise followed the recipe. Would
definitely make again. It was so fresh and healthy.

This recipe is really delicious. I’ve made it twice recently, using broccoli
instead of kale, and we loved it. However, both times the coconut milk curdled
towards the end of cooking. It did not affect the flavor, but the texture
wasn’t as creamy as I would have liked. Any suggestions?

Thank you for sharing, Katrina! Was it full cream? Did it seem like it was
chunky when you poured it in? It can separate in the can.

Kate,

I used to love using your recipes, but there are way, way too many video ads
on your website. They're so distracting that I can't even read a recipe.
You're driven me away.

Really delicious! I used sweet potatoes and tomatoes for the vegetables. I
steamed the cubed sweet potatoes before adding to the pot. With the rice, I
made coconut rice - can’t ever have too much coconut! Will definitely make
again. Thank you!

This recipe is terrific! I added mukimame and baked tofu for some added
protein and some sweet potato for more heft because I was aiming to make a
stew. Wonderful flavor! I added the extra tamari at the end as you suggested
and it added just what I was looking for. I also added a little sriracha for a
tiny bit of heat. This will be a go to recipe for us! Thank you!!

I omitted the sugar and added lime zest with the lime juice. And used spinach
instead of kale. It tastes great with chickpea noodles.I didn’t put soy or
Tamara sauce but added some tomato sauce.
