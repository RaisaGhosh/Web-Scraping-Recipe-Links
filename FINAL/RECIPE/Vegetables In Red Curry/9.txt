# Veggies in Thai Red Curry

Share

à¤à¤¸ à¤µà¥à¤¯à¤à¤à¤¨ à¤à¥ à¤¹à¤¿à¤¨à¥à¤¦à¥ à¤®à¥à¤ à¤ªà¤¢à¤¼à¥à¤

Thai food is very close to Indian food and probably thatâs the reason I just
love it. There are plenty of vegetarian options in Thai cuisine. Thai red
curry is one of the most popular curries. Usually the red curry paste is
prepared in advance with shallots, garlic, galangal (a variety of ginger),
lemon grass, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and lots of Thai red chilies. This
red paste is used in curry by adding coconut milk at the time of cooking.

For vegetarians and vegans, one can add a lot of vegetables like, onions, bell
peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, carrots etc. and one can also adjust
the spice as per taste. I recommend you to either use Thai red chilies or
Kashmiri red chilies to get a nice red color. This is a very delicious
preparation and has a lot of colorful vegetables which makes it healthy also.

## Some Other Thai delicacies

  * ## Lettuce Salad

Lettuce Salad With Sweet Onion Dressing is a Chinese style salad, which is
very refreshing and takes just a few minutes to make. I like the crunchy
leaves of iceberg lettuce for making this salad, but you can use the variety
of lettuce as per your taste and availability. In case if you do not have
lettuce or if you do not find...

  * ## Cucumber salad with sweet chili dressing and roasted peanuts

Cucumbers are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Super coolant cucumber
can be easily found in the farmers market and supermarkets, and can also be
easily grown in home garden, in containers in the balcony, sun room etc. This
cucumber salad is not only very easy and quick..
