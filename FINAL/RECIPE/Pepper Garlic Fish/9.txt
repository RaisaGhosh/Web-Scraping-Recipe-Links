Chinese Salt & Pepper Fish. Crispy Chinese fish with a delicious with a
flavourful and spicy kick. Takes only 30 minutes to whip up and is perfect for
dinner or leftovers!

My Chinese salt and pepper fish recipe is incredibly easy to make at home!
This version is also not deep-fried but shallow fried in oil making it
slightly more healthier than the version at the restaurant.

There is something about that salt and pepper flavour that is so classic in
terms of taste. In Chinese cuisine, there's so many versions of this flavour
profile, such as salt and pepper seafood, salt and pepper squid, pork, tofu,
chicken, shrimp, you name it! It's so versatile.

Chinese salt and pepper fish is a popular dish served at Asian restaurants and
it pairs deliciously with some steamed white rice and saucy vegetables. I
always ordered it with my husband.

You don't need a deep fryer for this recipe, just a large wok or pan since we
are shallow frying the fish. Just make sure to pat dry

so check them out below!

I am teaming up with the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)  for this recipe!
They have kindly sponsored it. As you know I'm a big supporter of clean oceans
and healthy fish that is ideally caught in the wild in a manner that respects
our oceans and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m happy to be working with the MSC; they are a
global non-profit organization that works to reverse overfishing, keep oceans
healthy, and protect our last major food source thatâ€™s truly wild: seafood!

This month is #NutritionMonth and the MSC is highlighting how seafood is a
healthy alternative to traditional land-based proteins â€“ and by choosing MSC
certified sustainable seafood, youâ€™re making a choice that is good for you and
the ocean too

## Why should you purchase sustainable seafood?

MSC Blue Fish Label ensures that the seafood you are consuming is caught
sustainably not damaging the oceans and other surrounding wildlife.

When you choose seafood with the @MSCbluefish label â€“ this means itâ€™s
certified sustainable, wild and traceable to its source, so itâ€™s good for the
oceans, too. By purchasing products with this label, it is a direct vote for
healthy oceans and itâ€™s so easy to do!

It's a small gesture but it has a huge impact on our ocean health. Just look
for the #MSCbluefish label when shopping to make a certified wild,
sustainable, and traceable choice! Know that your purchase is supporting a
well-managed, sustainable fishery that works hard to conserve the marine
environment

This way you can feel good about your seafood purchasing decisions. Itâ€™s
#FeelGoodSeafood!

## Did you know that fish is good for you?

The Seafood Nutrition Partnership recommends eating seafood at least two times
a week. Why?

  * Research shows that eating seafood at least twice per week reduces the risk of death from any health-related cause by 17 percent.
  * Seafood includes vital nutrients needed for health and wellness at all ages, including protein, omega-3s, B vitamins, and minerals like iron and selenium. These nutrients are essential for strong bones, brain development, and healthy heart and immune systems.

## What makes seafood a healthy protein choice?

  * Seafood is an excellent protein source because of its versatility and ease of cooking. Fish and shellfish are lean sources of protein. The fats in fish are heart-healthy omega-3, which are anti-inflammatory and have many benefits.
  * Fish is high-protein, low-fat food that provides a range of health benefits. Most white-fleshed fish are lower in fat than any other source of animal protein, and oily fish are high in omega-3 fatty acids, or the "good" fats.
  * When it comes to fish with the highest levels of omega-3s, thereâ€™s salmon, mackerel, and swordfish, to name a few.
  * According to the FDA, there is more vitamin B12 and vitamin D in seafood than any other type of food.

It came out very yummy! I found that the step of patting the fish dry is
crucial otherwise the fish ends up not being crispy. I was a bit uncertain
about how much fish is "two pieces." I cooked with 2lbs of fish and that
worked out pretty well. Also remember to include the scallions in step 4 (at
least I assume that's when they're supposed to go in). Thanks for all the info
on sustainable fish!

Thank you so much Joe for your kind review! Iâ€™m so glad you enjoyed the recipe
and thanks for the note on how much fish you used! And oops, forgot the step
on the scallions so thank you for reminding me to include that. Have a great
day!
