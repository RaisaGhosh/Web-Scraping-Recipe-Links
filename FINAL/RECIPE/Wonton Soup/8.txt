Almost synonymous with Chinese cuisine, the Wonton Soup is a sumptuous and
tongue-tickling soup that brings alive the flavours and textures of Oriental
cuisine.  
  
Wontons are like dumplings, in which a cover of plain flour dough holds
miscellaneous sautéed veggies. The wontons are cooked by boiling in a soup of
vegetable stock, perked up with ingredients like spring onions, ginger and
garlic.  
  
The crunchy veggies inside the wontons give it a nice mouth-feel, while the
soup gives it an awesome flavour. You must make sure you use the suggested
amount of oil while making the soup, in order to get the authentic taste and
consistency.  
  
Enjoy the Wonton Soup hot and fresh. You can also try other Chinese soups like
the Chinese Veg Soup and the Chinese Vegetable Clear Soup .
