## How to Make Wonton Soup

HideShow Media

1.

Knead the wonton dough with the ingredients and leave to rest.

2.

Trim the fat and bone off the meat and place it on a chopping board with the
spring onions, ginger and garlic and mince with a sharp knife till a well-
blended mass of mince is formed. Shape this mixture into marble-sized balls
and keep aside.

3.

Put the stock onto boil and then simmer.

4.

Roll the dough till translucent and cut into 5 cm squares.

5.

Fill the wontons.

6.

Place the ball of meat in one corner of the square piece of dough.

7.

Start rolling the meat in the cover till it reaches the center.

8.

Now pinch the two rolled sides thus formed, thereby sealing off the meat
completely in the cover.

9.

In order to make the wontons vegetarian fill them with shredded cabbage.

10.

Keep throwing the wontons into the simmering stock as you fill them they are
all done.

11.

Simmer till the wontons are cooked. They wrinkle up a little and the filling
becomes firm. This generally takes about 15 minutes.

12.

Add the rest of the soup ingredients, except the lettuce.

13.

To serve, divide the lettuce into the bowls and pour the hot soup over.

Key Ingredients: Flour, Egg, Oil, Cold water, For the Filling:,
Meat/Chicken/Cabbage(shredded), Garlic, Ginger, Spring onion/Onion, Black
pepper, Clear stock, Lettuce leaves, Carrot, Celery, Ajino moto (optional),
Salt
