# Hunan Shrimp

April 2, 2017 by victor 8 Comments

Similar to Hunan beef, hunan shrimp rely on use of hot chili peppers. Except
in this recipe we will be using hot chili oil along with the red pepper flakes
used to make it, instead of the chiles themselves. This reminds me of the
_Szechuan Chicken_ which also uses hot chile oil.

The chefs of Hunan love using hot oils and do it very skillfully. Hot oils and
hot peppers not only provide heat, but also season, balance, and complement
the dish. The pepper flakes used to make the hot oils are even more intensely
flavored than the oils.

Traditionally, shrimp is fried in quite a bit of oil. Instead, I like to do
'shallow frying' similar to what I did in the _Hunan Beef_ recipe.
Alternatively, stir-frying the shrimp with just three tablespoons of oil can
make an even healthier dish.

Author: Victor

### Ingredients

  * 1 lb large shrimp (peeled, leaving the tail segments intact, and de-veined)
  * 1 cup peanut oil (for frying)
  * 6 shallots (thinly sliced)
  * 1 Tbsp minced ginger
  * 3 large garlic cloves (minced)
  * 1 Tbsp Shaoxing wine

#### For the shrimp coating:

  * 1 egg white (lightly beaten)
  * 2 Tbsp peanut oil
  * 1 Tbsp mung bean starch
  * 2 Tbsp Shaoxing wine
  * 1 tsp sugar
  * 1 tsp sea or kosher salt
  * A pinch of white pepper

#### For the sauce:

  * 5 Tbsp ketchup
  * 1 Tbsp oyster sauce
  * 2 tsp white rice vinegar
  * 1 tsp hot pepper oil with pepper flakes (see my Szechuan Chicken recipe for details, for mild spiciness, plus more to taste)
  * 2 tsp light soy sauce
  * 1 tsp sugar
  * 1 tsp kosher salt (or sea salt)

### Instructions

  * Begin by mixing all of the shrimp coating ingredients in a medium size bowl. Add the shrimp, toss or mix by hand to coat. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes.

  * Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by mixing all of the ingredients for the sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.

#### Method 1

  * Heat a cup of peanut oil in a wok over medium-high heat to about 300F. Add the shrimp, spreading them evenly across the bottom in one layer. Fry for 1 minute, until the shrimp starts to turn pink, flip the shrimp and continue cooking for another minute. Using a slotted spoon, remove the shrimp from the wok and place on a paper towel lined plate to remove excess oil. You may want to do this step in two batches as it will be much easier.

  * Pour off the oil form the wok, leaving 3 tablespoons behind.Turn the heat to high. Add the garlic, the ginger and stir briefly. Add the shallots, stir briefly and lower the heat to medium. Stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the shallots are nicely caramelized and soft.

  * Return the heat back to high and add the shrimp. Drizzle the wine over the shrimp and mix well. Stir the sauce, pour it over the shrimp and mix well. Stir-fry for about 1-2 minutes, or until the shrimp are well-coated and the sauce begins to bubble.

#### Method 2

  * This is not the traditional Hunan shrimp preparation method that I know of, but I really like the results. Instead of shallow frying the shrimp, we will stir-fry them with just a little bit of oil. In a wok, heat three tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Just as you see a whiff of smoke, add the garlic and the ginger and stir briefly. Add the shallots, stir briefly and lower the heat to medium. Stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the shallots are nicely caramelized and soft.

  * Turn the heat back to high, add the shrimp, arranging them in a single layer. Cook for about 1 minute then flip and continue cooking for another minute or so, until the shrimp is pink on both sides.

  * Drizzle the wine over the shrimp and mix well. Stir in the sauce, pour it over the shrimp and mix well. Stir-fry for about 1-2 minutes, or until the shrimp are well-coated and the sauce begins to bubble.

#### Final step for both methods

  * Remove the shrimp from heat, transfer to a heated dish, and serve immediately with steamed rice or vegetables.

Tastes like take-out Hunan. Will make it again. Subbed out a couple of
ingredients I didn't have in the pantry, but still delicious.

Hi  
I have cooked this dish for dinner this evening.  
l was planning to cook with other recipe but couldn't be bothered to find the
recipe so tried yours. Because it looked good.  
I am so glad l have found your recipe.  
As Korean l am familiar with Chinese dishes and like to cook them from scratch
often.  
This is an easy and delicious near perfect Chinese shrimp dish.  
Much easier quicker than my old recipe which l got from famous Chinese chef's
cooking class long time ago.  
Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipes.

Hey Victor! My first time making this kind of a dish and I was a little
worried that I would mess it up. Your instructions were easy to follow and the
recipe is pretty good I should add. The shrimp turned out really good and I
got many compliments for it. I liked the flavors a lot. Very tasty! Keep those
recipes coming. Love reading your blog.

This looked so good that I decided to make it. It was a great decision. I am
sure I will be making this shrimp recipe again soon. The sauce was very tasty.

This recipe is the bomb! I followed the lighter method with less oil and the
shrimp turned out very good. Better than I expected, actually.
