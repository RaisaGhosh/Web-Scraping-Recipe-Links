Indo Chinese dish can be served as an appetizer or as a side dish along with
the main course. Simple ingredients like onion, ginger and garlic with a
combination of sauces, make this Chicken Manchurian, finger licking good even
at home.

Instead of deep frying the chicken, shallowing frying it too ensures the
chicken is slightly crunchy and cooked through well on the inside, minimizing
the usage of too much oil

Spicy Szechuan Vegetarian Noodles and make a delicious meal.

## How to make Chicken Manchurian Dry Recipe

  1. To begin making the Chicken Manchurian Dry recipe, first we will marinate the chicken cubes. 

  2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the washed and cleaned boneless chicken cubes along with the egg, salt, pepper, soya sauce, and corn flour. 

  3. Cover the bowl and marinate for 30-45 minutes. You can even let it rest in the refrigerator.

  4. Next, we will prepare the sauce for the chicken manchurian. In a mixing bowl combine the sauces - soy sauce, red chilli sauce, tomato ketchup and vinegar. Whisk well with a fork and keep aside.

  5. Next heat oil over medium heat for pan frying, add the chicken pieces until well cooked and crispy. Boneless chicken does not take time to cook, so as soon as you notice that it is turning golden and crisp on medium heat, transfer onto a plate lined with absorbent kitchen towels and keep aside.

  6. You can also optionally grill the chicken in a pan to cook the chicken. It gives a great taste to the manchurian as well. 

  7. Heat oil in a wok, add ginger, garlic, and green chillies. Toss for thirty seconds. 

  8. Stir in the sliced onions and saute until the onion turns soft and lightly brown. 

  9. Next stir in the sauce mixture and give it a brisk boil for about a minute.

  10. Finally stir in the pan fried chicken and toss well to bring the Chicken Manchurian together. Stir fry the Chicken Manchurian along with the sauces for 3 to 4 minutes until the chicken pieces are well coated.

  11. Check salt and seasonings and adjust according to taste. Finally stir in the spring onion greens and turn off the heat.

  12. Transfer the Chicken Manchurian to a serving bowl and serve hot.

  13. Serve Chicken Manchurian Dry as an appetizer or for dinner along with Spicy Szechuan Vegetarian Noodles and make a delicious meal.
