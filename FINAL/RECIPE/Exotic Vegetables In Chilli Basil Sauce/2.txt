Stir- fried greens in spicy sauce, although it sounds exotic, this recipe is
easy to make. Just buy all the ‘green’ vegetables in advance and prepare them
so you can save time. You can use pak choi (chinese cabbage), broccoli,
zucchini, asparagus and green capsicum, and you’ll have a gravy that looks
very appealing to the eye. Serve it with rice or noodles and watch your loved
ones relish its different taste!
