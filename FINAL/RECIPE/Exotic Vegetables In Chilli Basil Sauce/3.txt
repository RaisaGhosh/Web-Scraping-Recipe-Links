It is a time when we all want to experiment with our cooking and create dishes
that are not only delicious, but also restaurant-like. The satisfaction at
dishing out a recipe exactly as you had imagined your favourite restaurant
will serve, is something else! Of course, add to that the compliments you will
receive and your day is made. **Chef Sanjyot Keer, founder of Your Food Lab,**
brings you one such exotic and delicious recipe. It is a dish that your family
will want second helpings of, and you will not deny their requests.  
  
 **Vegetables In Paprika Sauce With Spinach Rice  
**  

  
**Prep Time:** 20 minutes  
 **Cooking Time:**  40 minutes  
 **Serves:** 4  
  
 **For The Spinach Rice**  
 **Ingredients:  
  
**

_Image:  Shutterstock_  
  
• 1 big bunch spinach  
• A pinch of salt to blanch the spinach  
• 1 tbsp fresh mint leaves  
• 1 tbsp fresh coriander leaves  
• 2 green chillies  
• 1-2 ice cubes  
• 1 tsp butter  
• 1 tsp oil  
• 1 tbsp garlic, finely chopped  
• 1 tsp red chilli flakes  
• 5 cups cooked basmati rice  
• Salt to taste  
• A pinch of black pepper powder  
• 1 tsp lemon juice  
  
**Method:**  
1\. Set water for boiling, add the cleaned and washed spinach leaves and a
pinch of salt and blanch for few seconds, remove and immediately transfer to
ice cold water. This process helps in retaining the bright green colour of the
spinach.  
2\. Now, transfer the spinach to a grinding jar along with the fresh mint
leaves, coriander leaves, green chillies and few ice cubes, grind to a fine
puree and keep aside.  
3\. Set a wok on medium heat, add the butter and oil, garlic and red chilli
flakes, cook for 1-2 minutes on medium flame, now add the spinach puree and
cook for 4-5 minutes.  
4\. Now add the cooked rice, salt to taste, black pepper powder and lemon
juice, stir and cook for 2-3 minutes. Stir gently without breaking the rice
grains. Spinach rice is ready, serve hot with hot paprika sauce.  
  
**For The Paprika Sauce And Saut eed Veggies:**  
 **  
1\. For the saut eed veggies:**  
 **Ingredients:  
  
**

_Image:  Shutterstock_  
  
• 1 tsp oil  
• 1 tbsp chopped garlic  
• 1 tsp red chilli flakes  
• 1/3 cup baby corn  
• 1/3 cup carrot  
• 1/3 cup zucchini  
• 1/3 cup mushroom  
• 1/3 cup mixed bell peppers  
• 1/3 cup broccoli  
• Salt to taste  
• Pepper powder to taste  
  
 **Method:**  
1\. For sauteed veggies, set a wok on medium heat, add the oil, garlic and red
chilli flakes, cook for 2-3 minutes.  
2\. Now, add baby corn and carrot and cook for 2-3 minutes, further add the
remaining veggies, salt and pepper to taste, stir and cook for 2-3 minutes.  
3\. Sauteed veggies are ready, keep aside to be added later in the paprika
sauce.  
  
 **2\. For The Paprika Sauce:**  
 **Ingredients:**

_Image:  Shutterstock_  
  
• 2 tbsp butter  
• 2 tbsp refined flour  
• 600 ml milk  
• 1 tbsp paprika powder  
• Salt to taste  
• A pinch of black pepper powder  
• A pinch of nutmeg powder  
• 150 gm paneer, cubed  
  
 **Method:**  
1\. For paprika sauce, set a saucepan or wok on low heat, add the butter and
flour, stir and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the milk in 3-4 batches,
continuously whisking to avoid lump formation. Cook the sauce until it is
thick and creamy.  
2\. Add the paprika (substitute with red chilli powder if you don't have
paprika), salt to taste, black pepper and nutmeg powders, mix well and cook
for 1-2 minutes.  
3\. Once the sauce is well cooked, add the sauteed veggies and cook to mix for
about 1-2 minutes. Finally, add the paneer and mix gently.  
4\. Paprika sauce with sauteed veggies and paneer is ready, serve hot with hot
spinach rice.
