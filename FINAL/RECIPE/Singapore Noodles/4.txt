# Delicious Singapore Noodle Stir Fry with Curry Powder

_Delicious Singapore Noodles! Stir-friedrice noodles with curry powder,
vegetables and your choice of chicken, tofu, eggs, or shrimp! A 30-minute,
Chinese take-out menu classic that is easy to make at home- vegetarian
adaptable and full of authentic flavor!_

_She said she usually cried at least once each day not because she was sad,
but because the world was so beautiful & life was so short._ _― Brian Andreas_

Singapore Noodles, contrary to how they sound, actually originate from China
and are most often found in Chinese restaurants around the globe.

## _Why are they called Singapore Noodles?  _

Why they're named Singapore noodles is still a bit unclear, but it is
believed, that a Cantonese chef in China created these noodles as a way to
showcase how multicultural Cantonese cooking could be, by adding curry powder.

In this recipe for  Singapore Noodles, rice noodles are stir-fried in a wok
with vegetables, seasoned with madras curry powder.  Add chicken, tofu,
scrambled eggs or shrimp!  _It is a dry-style Chinese noodle dish, rather than
a saucy noodle dish.  _

## _How to make Singapore Noodles!_

## **_Are Singapore noodles healthy?_**

Singapore noodles are loaded up with healthy veggies that are very quickly
stirfried why still retaining their fresh crunchy texture, nutrients and
vibrancy.

I prefer this dish on the spicy side, but for younger palates, feel free to
keep it mild. Today I've opted to keep it vegetarian and used tofu, but
chicken or shrimp would work great here too.

Singapore Noodles start with stir-frying the protein, in this case, tofu in a
1-2 tablespoons oil.  You can also add chicken or add shrimp!



Set the crispy tofu aside, then stir-fry the veggies, starting with the sliced
onion. Then I added bell pepper, carrots, garlic and snow peas.

Other veggies work well too, like cabbage, bok choy, green beans or mushrooms.
A great way to clean out your veggie drawer.

Next, make a well in the center of the veggies and basically, scramble the
eggs.

Then set the veggies and eggs aside and stir-fry the cooked vermicelli rice
noodles

_**A little tip.**_ After you cook and drain the vermicelli noodles, cut them
into thirds so they are easier to manage in the wok. This will help
tremendously!

You can also soak the noodles in cold water until tender- see package
instructions.

Give the noodles a quick stir-fry, add a few dried red chilies for heat if you
like, then add the veggies and tofu back into the pan.

Sprinkle with the curry powder, the Singapore Noodle Sauce and toss everything
well to incorporate.

If you don't have a wok, a large skillet will work too!

If you are wanting to double this recipe, make sure to cook it in two batches.
It would be difficult to manage all in one wok.

Serve immediately with chopsticks, scallions and hot chili paste or chili
flakes for those who want extra heat.

Remember, this is not a saucy dish, but rather a "dry" noodle dish.

The leftovers taste amazing too!

vermicelli noodle dish, hailing from China, with veggies, tofu and the
signature ingredient, madras curry powder! Yum!

A tasty recipe for Singapore Noodles! Stir-fried rice noodles with madras
curry powder, vegetables and your choice of chicken, tofu or shrimp—a Chinese
take-out menu classic that is easy to make at home - vegetarian adaptable and
full of authentic flavor!

  * **Author:** Sylvia Fountaine
  * **Prep Time:** 20
  * **Cook Time:** 20
  * **Total Time:** 40 minutes
  * **Yield:** 3-4
  * **Category:** main, gluten-free
  * **Method:** stir-fried
  * **Cuisine:** Chinese

### Ingredients

  1. 8-10 ounces chicken or tofu cut into ¾ inch cubes ( or whole raw shrimp)
  2. ¼ teaspoon salt
  3. 1-2 tablespoons wok oil - a high temp oil like peanut oil
  4. 4-5 ounces vermicelli rice noodles (don't use more-see notes)
  5. ½ an onion, sliced thin
  6. 1 cup match stick carrots, or 1 carrot shredded
  7. 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
  8. 1-2 cups snow peas ( or sub green beans, baby bok choy or shredded cabbage)
  9. 4 cloves garlic, rough chopped
  10. 2 eggs, whisked with a fork, with a 3 finger pinch of salt
  11. 3-6 dried red chili peppers ( or sub chili flakes at the end)
  12. 1 tablespoon madras curry powder ( yellow curry powder)
  13. ½ teaspoon turmeric
  14. ½ teaspoon salt, and more to taste

**Singapore Noodle Sauce:**

  1. 1 tablespoon shaoxing wine (chinese cooking wine, or mirin, or white wine)
  2. 1 teaspoon sesame oil
  3. 1 teaspoon soy sauce (or sub-gluten-free soy sauce, like Braggs)
  4. 1 teaspoon fish sauce (or sub vegan fish sauce)
  5. 1 teaspoon sugar or honey or other substitutes

### Instructions

  1. Bring a medium pot of water to boil on the stove for the rice noodles.
  2. Make the Singapore Noodle Sauce, stirring the ingredients together in a small bowl. Set by the stove.
  3. Prep the veggies: slice the onion, slice the bell pepper and chop the garlic, placing all by the stove, along with the carrots and snow peas.
  4. Pat dry the chicken/tofu and cut into ¾ inch cubes. ( If using shrimp, leave whole) Heat oil in a wok, over medium heat and add ¼ teaspoon kosher salt directly into the oil. Swirl and add cracked pepper if you like, and when the oil is hot, carefully add the chicken/tofu/shrimp. Using a metal spatula, stir, flip and let it get golden, being patient. Place on a paper towel-lined plate.
  5. Whisk the two eggs with a 3 finger pinch of salt in a small bowl. Set by the stove.
  6. Add the onion to the wok and stir 3 minutes, on medium-high heat, until fragrant, then add carrots, bell pepper and snow peas and garlic. Continue stirring for just a couple minutes, until just wilted. Make a well in the center of the veggies, and add a drop of oil, then pour in the eggs, scrambling them and chopping them up a bit with the metal spatula. Incorporate them into the veggies, then slide the whole veggie egg mixture onto a plate, setting aside.
  7. Place the noodles in the boiling water, turn heat off, and let stand 3-4 minutes before draining ( OR read directions on the package, every noodle brand is different) Drain when they are al-dente. Using kitchen scissors, cut the noodles into thirds or fourths (cutting is important!) and fluff them up a bit, pulling them apart with a fork or tongs.
  8. Add 1-2 teaspoons oil to the wok, then add the cooked noodles and stir fry them a bit, over medium heat about 2-3 minutes, letting them soften a bit. Add the whole dried chilies, stirring 1 minute.
  9. Spread the noodles out as best you can in the wok and slide the cooked veggies and seared chicken/ tofu/ shrimp back into the wok and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon curry powder, ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon turmeric and toss and stir until everything is evenly coated.
  10. Pour the Singapore Noodle Sauce into the noodles. It will smell fishy at first but this will disappear. Toss and cook for about 1-2 minutes, until noodles are almost dry. Taste, adjust salt and heat. Add chili flakes for more spicy. More salt if it tastes bland. Serve right away. Leftovers are delicious too.
  11. This is a dry-style, Chinese Noodle dish, not meant to be saucy. 😉

### Notes

Resist the urge to add more than 4 ounces noodles ( roughly 2 cups dry) ….I
know, it won't seem like enough at first, but trust me, they will double. Plus
you want this to be veggie "heavy" …and _**adding more noodles will result in
a bland finished dish. 😉**_

I've made this with rice noodles before, but I just made it with ramen noodles
because it's what I had in the pantry and it's just as fantastic!!

This is on my rotation! I attended an event where you had to cook a dish from
the country of your choice - mine being Singapore. I am SO glad because this
has now become a favourite. People always ask for the recipe 😉 Also love the
dry noodle style and all the veggies! Yum!!!!

Once my veggies were cut and my noodle sauce whisked, this took no time to put
together to great fanfare. So many veggies in in the most delicious way.

Sylvia's recipes hit the spot every time so these days I come to

You can just leave them out Barbara or add more tofu. 🙂

Thankyou for this recipe. I Have a vegetarian in a family of carnivores, so I
cooked the meat and some tofu separately and added them to the the bowls
instead of the dish. Everyone loved it. It was full of flavour and texture,
just awesome.

So good! Thanks, Sylvia. Great detailed directions, very helpful, and I
agree—cutting the noodles is very important, makes combining them with the
veggie mixture so much easier. I used two Hodo brand veg-tofu burgers, sliced,
to stand in for the chicken/tofu/shrimp (they browned and crisped up nicely),
and scrambled tofu in place of the eggs. Super recipe.🙏🏼

I actually rate this recipe better than my local noodle shop. I used a dry
white wine as it was all that I had at the time and it was sensational. I used
dried chilli flakes for zing and mangrove honey for a little sweetness in the
sauce. The turmeric is a nice touch. Thanks
