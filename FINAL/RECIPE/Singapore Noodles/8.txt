Singapore Noodles

Singapore Noodles or Singapore Mei Fun are on my favorite Chinese take-out
restaurant menu, offered alongside fried rice and chow mein as a side dish. I
almost always pick it for my meal combo as it‚Äôs similar to our Filipino bihon.

Although both dishes use rice noodles and include various bite-sized meats,
vegetables, and seafood, the former is set apart by curry powder seasoning,
which lends it its characteristic flavor and color.

## Ingredient suggestions

The fast-food version is usually a simple hodge-podge of pork, carrots,
cabbage, and rice noodles, but you can easily ramp up this stir-fry into a
more substantial one-pot meal at home.

I used chicken, Chinese sausages, shrimp, eggs, bell peppers, and bean sprouts
in this recipe, but char sui pork, smoked ham, shitake mushrooms, napa
cabbage, carrots, celery, pak choi, snap peas, and green onions are also some
of the things you can add to this delightful noodle dish.

The noodles are rice vermicelli and not to be confused with mung bean
vermicelli or cellophane noodles.

##  Cooking tips

  * Use rice noodle vermicelli which is similar to Filipino bihon and NOT mung bean vermicelli or sotanghon.
  * If you can‚Äôt find Chinese cooking wine (Shaoxing wine), you can substitute dry **sherry or chicken broth**.
  * Soak the rice noodles **just until softened** as they will continue to cook when stir-fried. It might take a few minutes or longer depending on the brand so check your package directions.
  * This is a mostly dry noodle dish. Add water in 1/2 cup increments as needed to cook the noodles until tender but firm to bite.

## Serving suggestions

Singapore noodles make a great-tasting main dish or as a side dish for lunch
or dinner. Serve with honey walnut shrimp or salt and pepper pork chops, and
steamed rice for a Chinese-themed meal!

## More noodle recipes

  * Miki Bihon-a delightful mix of rice vermicelli and fresh egg noodles plus loads of chicken, shrimp and veggies
  * Pancit Palabok-rice noodles are slathered with a flavorful shrimp sauce and topped with shrimp, crushed chicharon and boiled eggs
  * Pancit Lomi-a thick and hearty noodle soup perfect for chilly days

  * 1/4 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined 
  * 4 pieces  Chinese sausage, sliced thinly on a bias
  * 4 eggs
  * 1 onion, peeled and sliced thinly
  * 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

### Instructions

  * In a large bowl, combine vermicelli and enough hot water to cover. Soak until just softened and pliable. Drain well.

  * In a small bowl, combine oyster sauce, soy sauce, Chinese wine, and sugar. Whisk together until well-combined. Set aside.

  * In a bowl, combine chicken and cornstarch. Stir to fully coat and let stand for about 8 to 10 minutes. 

  * In a wide pan over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Add shrimp and cook just until color changes to pink. With a slotted spoon, remove from wok and keep warm.

  * Add another 2 tablespoons of oil and heat. Add chicken and cook until color changes. 

  * Add Chinese sausages and cook until lightly browned. With a slotted spoon, remove from pan and keep warm.

  * Add another 1 tablespoon of oil. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.

  * Add bell peppers and cook until tender yet crisp. 

  * Add rice noodles, chicken, sausages, and shrimp. 

  * Add sauce mixture and sprinkle in curry powder. Using tongs, toss gently to combine until noodles are evenly colored.

  * Add water. Cook, tossing regularly until liquid is absorbed and noodles are cooked through yet firm to bite. 

  * Add the scrambled eggs and bean sprouts. Toss for another 1 to 2 minutes or until heated through. 

  * Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot.

### Notes

  * The recipe calls for rice noodle vermicelli which is similar to Filipino bihon and NOT mung bean vermicelli or sotanghon.
  * Soak the rice noodles **just until softened** as they will continue to cook when stir-fried. It might take a few minutes or longer depending on the brand so check your package directions.
  * This is a mostly dry noodle dish. Add water in1/2 cup increments as needed to cook the noodles until cooked but firm to bite.

I'm glad I was able to show someone the difference. I kept explaining that
curry is the huge difference between Singapore noodles and pancit. Great
recipe.

Yes, the addition of curry makes all the difference. üôÇ

I really like the thinness of these noodles‚Ä¶this is really my style. I'm not
really into thick noodles, either.

This looks delicious! I do enjoy various oriental dishes. Do you know if these
noodles are gluten-free?

They are rice noodles, so they are naturally gluten free.

I like it. I prefer our own noodles rather than the Singaporean ones but I
think I can whip out my own variation using your recipe with just the noodle
tweak. This will also be successful abroad, I'm saying it now!
