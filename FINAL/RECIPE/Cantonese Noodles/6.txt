# Cantonese Chow Mein

By á-44083

A Cantonese chef -- my roommate-- gave me this recipe that I translated into
English. It's pan-fried egg noodles (crispy brown in places) topped with a mix
of vegetables and seafood in a light white sauce. Very nice.

## Preparation

### Step 1

1 Immerse egg noodles into boiling water for 30 seconds, then remove and set
aside.  
2 Heat your wok at high heat, keep it dry. Add 5 tbsp oil and coat the wok
evenly with oil.  
3 Fry the noodles for about 2 minutes, and keep shaking it back and forth,
until the noodles turn golden brown. Flip and repeat.  
4 The outer noodles should be golden, inner ones are soft. Remove noodles and
arrange in center of a plate.  
5 Blanch the vegetables in boiling water (30 seconds). You can arrange the bok
choy in a circle around the noodles if you like.  
6 Put some oil and fry minced garlic in the work, then add the blanched
vegetables and stir fry. Add the meat ingredients, 1 tbsp water, cover the wok
and steam for 1 - 2 minutes.  
7 Add the flavouring ingredients, the water with corn starch, and fry gently.
Add a bit more water if you want more sauce. 8 Pour the veggies and meat over
the noodles.  
9 Note #1: Char xiu (Honey BBQ pork) is available in Chinatown or a good
Chinese grocery store, as well as baby boy choy (also known as Shanghai bok
choy).  
10 Note #2: Ideally you should use a large non-stick wok for frying noodles.
Traditionally, Chinese people use a carbon steel wok, which is baked in the
oven after purchase, and then rubbed with oil after washing each time to
protect it. It turns black over time, and is pretty much non-stick. You could
also use a non-stick pan, but non-stick coatings are poisonous and will
accumulate in your body. Non-stick pans should generally be only used with
medium or low heat. If you like them, get a professional grade non-stick pan
for high heat cooking, it feels like ceramic.  
11 Note #3: I often add a dash of rice wine (sake) to the meat and vegetables.
It just gives it a little extra flavour and isn't salty like most cooking
wines.
