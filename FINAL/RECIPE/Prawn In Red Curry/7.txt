## Ingredients

  * 200g basmati rice
  * 1 tbsp groundnut oil
  * 2cm fresh ginger, cut into matchsticks
  * 2 garlic cloves, finely sliced
  * 1 red chilli, finely sliced
  * 2-3 tbsp Thai red curry paste (see tip)
  * 400ml tin coconut milk
  * 1 tbsp Thai fish sauce
  * 100ml vegetable stock
  * 6 baby pak choi, halved or quartered
  * 450g raw, peeled king prawns
  * Juice of 1 lime, plus wedges to serve
  * Handful of fresh coriander, chopped

## Method

  1. Put the rice in a pan and rinse well in cold water. Drain, then add more water to 1cm above the level of the rice. Bring to a simmer over a gentle heat, cook for 1 minute, then cover tightly, turn off the heat and leave to cook undisturbed.
  2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in another saucepan, add the ginger, garlic and chilli and soften for a couple of minutes. Add the red curry paste and cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes, then add two thirds of the coconut milk along with the fish sauce and vegetable stock. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 5-6 minutes. Add the pak choi and the prawns, then cook for 4-5 minutes more.
  3. Check the rice is cooked and all the liquid has been absorbed, then stir through the remaining coconut milk until well combined. Serve the curry scattered with coriander.
