## **20-Minute Red Curry Shrimp Recipe**

If you have a jar of red curry paste and a can of coconut milk then you're
minutes away from a satisfying dinner. This red curry shrimp is full of spice
and rich flavor. Plus it's quick and easy to make!

The base of the recipe is a fragrant coconut curry sauce that is equally as
tasty on its own. The secret to the sauce is plenty of aromatics, like onion,
ginger, and garlic, combined with full-fat coconut milk. Plus lime juice and
cilantro to offset the richness of the sauce.

There‚Äôs lots of sauce with delicious plump shrimp to serve over cooked rice or
skip the rice and simply serve it with some naan bread.

## **Ingredients for Red Curry Shrimp**

  * **Aromatics** : Red onion, ginger, and garlic. I recommed grating the ginger with a **microplane** and mincing the garlic yourself. Avoid using jarred garlic. 
  * **Coconut Milk:** Canned, unsweetened coconut milk is what you'll need for this recipe. For extra creaminess, use full-fat and not lite coconut milk.
  *  **Red Curry Paste** : Readily available at most supermarkets, red curry paste is a pantry must have. It provides amazing flavor and zing to this dish. I personally love the **Thai Kitchen brand** curry paste, made of red chili pepper, garlic, lemongrass, salt, shallots, coriander root, and kaffir lime peel. It not too spicy compared to other brands.
  *  **Vegetables:** Change up the vegetables to suit your taste. I like bell peppers in this dish but a variety of other vegetables work too. See below for a list of ideas.
  *  **Shrimp** : Peeled jumbo-sized shrimp with tails on or off works great in this recipe. If frozen, thaw out first.
  *  **Everything Else:** For the sauce, you'll also need honey, fish sauce, and creamy peanut butter. To finish off the dish, lime zest, juice, and fresh cilantro.

## **What Other Vegetables Can I Add?**

Feel free to change up the vegetables, as long as you slice them so they're
about the same size.

  * **Broccoli**
  *  **Green beans**
  *  **Mushrooms**
  *  **Spinach**
  *  **Cauliflower**
  *  **Carrots**

## **How to Make Red Curry Shrimp**

In a large skillet, at least 12-inch, heat oil over medium heat. Add red
onions and cook until softened, about 4-5 minutes. Stir in ginger and garlic.
Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly.

Add coconut milk, red curry paste, honey, fish sauce, peanut butter, and a
little bit of water. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer. Add
sliced bell peppers, reduce heat, and simmer covered until almost tender,
about 5-7 minutes.

Pat dry the shrimp with a few sheets of papers towels. Season with salt and
pepper. Add to the sauce and cook until shrimp just turn opaque, stirring
often about 3 minutes.

Stir in lime zest, juice, and cilantro.

## **How Does It Taste?**

Your taste buds are in for a treat! This red curry shrimp has many layers of
flavors, starting with the sauce. It's bold, slightly spiced, with hints of
sweetness, and plenty of creaminess.

Chicken Vegetable Curry**.

### Description

_Red curry shrimp is an easy dish that only takes 20-minutes to prepare. The
shrimp are simmered in a fragrant coconut curry sauce that you 'll want to eat
by a spoonful!_

* * *

### Ingredients

Units USM Scale 1x2x3x

  * 2 Tbsp. olive oil _or avocado oil_
  * 1 small red onion, _thinly sliced, about 1 cup_
  * 1 Tbsp. finely grated ginger, _use a **microplane**_
  * 1 Tbsp. minced garlic
  * 1 (14 oz.) can coconut milk
  * 2 Tbsp. **red curry paste**
  * 2 tsp. honey
  * 4 tsp. **fish sauce**
  * 1 Tbsp. creamy peanut butter
  * 1/3 cup water
  * 1 small bell pepper (any color), _sliced into thin strips_
  * 12 oz. peeled and deveined jumbo shrimp, _tails on or off, thawed if frozen_
  * 1 Tbsp. fresh lime juice
  * Zest of 1 lime
  * 1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro
  * **Kosher salt** and black pepper, _to taste_

* * *

### Instructions

  1. Heat oil in a large skillet, at least 12-inches, over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds, while stirring continuously.
  2. Add the coconut milk, curry paste, honey, fish sauce, peanut butter, and water. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a simmer and whisk the sauce until smooth and lump-free.
  3. Add bell peppers and cook for about 5-7 minutes, covered, or until the peppers are almost tender. Slightly reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. 
  4. In the meantime, lightly pat dry the shrimp with a few sheets of paper towel to remove excess moisture. Season the shrimp all over with salt and pepper, to taste. 
  5. Uncover the sauce and stir in the shrimp and cook for about 3 minutes or until shrimp just turn opaque, stirring often. The sauce will also slightly reduce and thicken.
  6. Stir in lime juice, lime zest, and cilantro. Serve over cooked rice.

### Notes

  * **Coconut Milk:** For a rich and creamy sauce, use unsweetened, regular (not light/reduced fat) coconut milk.
  * **Red Curry Paste:** You can find red curry paste at most grocery stores in the Asian section of the store. I like the Thai Kitchen brand, which is not overly spicy. 
  * **Fish Sauce:** Fish sauce is an aromatic Asian condiment that adds a salty, umami flavor to the curry. The dish does not taste fishy. I do not recommend a substitute. Fish sauce can be found at most grocery stores in the Asian section of the store.
  * **Leftovers:** Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2-3 days in the refrigerator.

Excellent and easy recipe! Tasted great! Only modification: I chopped up and
added a few Thai chillies to give it some heat! ü§Ø

This recipe was absolutely amazing. The flavor was divine. I was looking for a
new shrimp recipe for my family and this was a hit! At first, I was a little
weary of being able to find all of the ingredients in my local grocery, but
they had everything in the ‚Äúinternational‚Äù isle. My husband is ‚Äúvery meat and
potatoes‚Äù eater but he love this dish. He came back for second and even thirds
(I should have made a larger batch). Thank you so very much for this delicious
recipe.

I've made red thai curry a few times and was surprised by the addition of
peanut butter and honey but wow, what a great difference! Loved it. For me, I
enjoyed it even more before adding the lime (which is odd as I love lime) so
next time I will stop before adding it.

Thank you for this recipe!
