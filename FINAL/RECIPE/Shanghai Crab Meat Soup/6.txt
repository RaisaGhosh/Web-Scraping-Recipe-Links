##  Shanghai’s culinary scene is as unique as its architecture and history

Fast and technologically forward, these are the two words that come to our
mind the moment we hear about Shanghai. As the largest and second most
populated city of China, Shanghai boasts a blended culture of East and West,
much due to its colonial history. When it comes to food, a unique blend of
Benbang and Haipai cuisines can be seen in the traditional Hu Cuisine, which
still remains an underdog when it comes to China's major cuisines. Youngest in
the list but favoured by many, the Shanghainese are known to have a sweet
tooth, as sugar and soy are used in the ratio of 1:1 in signature Shanghai
dishes, making it distinctive from China's other regional dishes. Here's what
we are talking about:

A classic Hu dish, Xiao Long Bao are soup dumplings and probably one of the
first dishes you should try while visiting Shanghai. The dumplings - served in
small bamboo baskets they're steamed in, have delicate skins encasing pork-
based filling and delicious meat broth. While steaming, the gelatinised meat
broth chunks melt, making it into a soup which gives an explosion of rich,
steaming, hot juice oozing right into your mouth. Careful, as these pillowy
delights are presented piping hot so give each dumpling some soy sauce and
vinegar baths before chewing them right away. Due to its thin skin, the main
objective is to eat it without rupturing it. So here's a little trick for the
newbies, use a Chinese soup spoon. Or even better, just use your hand if you
can't resist this tender and juicy delight for that long!

**Hairy Crab**  
Some people say you really haven't experienced Shanghai unless you've eaten a
Hairy Crab. A Shanghainese delicacy, during late fall and early winter you'll
find hairy crab sold on every street corner and every restaurant. Because of
Shanghai's proximity to the Yangtze River and the East China Sea, steamed crab
is one of the many seafood dishes enjoyed by locals. The famed steamed crabs
are tied with ropes and strings, kept in a bamboo container with few extra
ingredients such as scallions and fragrant ginger. The result is firm, yet
tender and delicate meat which is slightly sweeter than regular crab meat. The
dish is served with a dash of rice vinegar, sugar and ginger sauce for
dipping.  The laborious part, however, is picking apart the whole carb. In
traditional Chinese medicine, crabmeat is considered as 'cold' food, so don't
hesitate to pair your meal with a flask of warming Shaoxing rice wine
(obviously recommended!).

**Shi zi Tou**  
Another of Shanghai's most beloved dish is Shi zi Tou or Lion's Head
Meatballs. Now, the dish isn't exactly made from a lion's head but is
fashioned from grounded pork meatballs simmered in soy sauce and sugar and
braised with bok choy. The meatballs are moist and tender with a unique blend
of sweet and savoury flavour. Often consumed with rice, the delicate and porky
nuances of these meatballs are quite irresistible. As a matter of fact, these
giant meatballs got their name from the banquet for the State Governor of Xun,
where the officials called him a fierce lion and commended him for his
achievements.

**Beggar 's Chicken**  
A uniquely cooked chicken which involves stuffed and marinated chicken that is
covered with several layers of lotus leaves and finally sealing it in a
parchment paper. After 6 hours of slow baking, the result is tender, juicy and
aromatic chicken easily falling off its bones. There is a very interesting
folktale behind Beggar's Chicken. Legends say this uniquely cooked chicken
dates back to Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), when a hungry beggar who lived in
Shanghai's neighbouring town of Changshu, stole a chicken from a local farm
and hid it in the mud till the farmer went to sleep. Then without even
cleaning it, he cooked it over the fire.  
  
**Hong Shao Rou**

Red-cooking--known as hong shao in Chinese--is a style prevalent throughout
all of China. The colour and taste are achieved by slow-cooking proteins in
soy sauce with sugar and fermented bean paste. Hong Shao Rou or Red Braised
Pork Belly is a classic crowd-pleaser. Sweet and caramelised chunks of pork
belly are simmered in light and dark soy sauce with a dash of brown sugar
along with fresh ginger, garlic, green onion, and star anise. This dish is
typically served with hard-boiled eggs and its tender meat will melt in your
mouth.  
  
**Lade Tiao**  
This one is for spice lovers and adventurous eaters. Lade Tiao is the spiciest
dish of Shanghai. This popular dish features bullfrog meat slow-cooked in five
different types of chilli peppers. The dish is so hot and daunting that one
time, a restaurant in Shanghai ran a promotion, offering Lade Tiao free of
cost to the person who can finish it within an hour.
