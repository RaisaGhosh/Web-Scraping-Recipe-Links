The autumn wind blows, the maple leaves are red, and the crab is fat! October
is the most delicious season for hairy crabs. We have a soup made of crabmeat
and crab roe, which is called Yipinxian because of its delicious taste. We
make it several times a year!

## Ingredients

  * 1 Hairy Crabs

  * 1 box Lactone Tofu

  * 1 piece Egg

  * 20g Parsley

  * Some Salt

  * a little Pepper

  * A teaspoon Corn Oil

  * a little Vinegar

  * A tablespoon Water Starch

  * Some Grated Ginger

## Yipin Fresh Crab Soup

1. A hairy crab is steamed and peeled off the meat and yellow for use 

2. Rinse a box of internal fat tofu and cut it into small pieces with a knife (actually use half a box) 

3. Heat a teaspoon of oil in the wok, add ginger froth and stir fry until fragrant, add crab meat and crab roe, stir fry 

4. Put the fried crabmeat and crab roe into a small soup pot, add 2 small bowls of water and half a box of tofu to simmer, add some salt to taste 

5. The soup will boil for about 1 minute, add egg liquid and water starch, add a little vinegar and pepper to taste, sprinkle with coriander and serve in a bowl 

> **Tips:**
>
> 1\. Because the crab meat is very delicious, there should not be too many
> ingredients in the soup.  
>  2\. Stir fry crab meat and crab yolk.  
>  3\. Don't boil the soup for a long time.
