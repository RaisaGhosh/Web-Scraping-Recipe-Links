# Chinese Salt and Pepper Fried Fish Fillet

Jump to Recipe Print Recipe

Simplicity at its finest. Fried tilapia sautéed with salt, pepper, scallions,
and red chilies. Ready in under 30 minutes!

## Why You'll Love this Recipe

  * It's a **simple** but **delicious** dish with **minimal ingredients**.
  * It's ready in **under 30 minutes** and **cooks in just 5 minutes**!
  * Its seasonings allows the flavor of the fish to shine.

I love cooking with seafood and especially fish because it cook so fast. My
dad had a dish called "salt and pepper white fish" on the menu of his
**Chinese take out **restaurant.

It's a simple dish that was made with swai fish coated in corn starch, fried,
then stir fried with scallions, salt and pepper. He served it on a bed of
iceberg lettuce.

I love the tender texture of the dish and the minimal seasonings so the flavor
of the fish shines.

## Ingredients

  * **Tilapia:** I used tilapia fillets since it was on sale and easily accessible. However, you can make this with any lean and firm white fish like swai, cod, or haddock. Shrimp would also work!
  *  **Corn starch:** The corn starch creates a light coating and crisp edges around the fish with. Potato starch can also work in a pinch.
  *  **Oil:** I used canola. Use any high heat oil like vegetable or avocado oil.
  *  **Black pepper:** Freshly ground black pepper is best, but pre-ground also works! If you have smoked black pepper, even better!
  *  **Scallions:** White parts only.
  *  **Red Chili:** I like adding a Thai red chili for a little spicy kick and some color. Red pepper flakes or Sichuan peppercorns will give it a similar effect.
  *  **Sugar:** A dash of sugar rounds out the dish, but feel free to omit it.

## How to Chinese Salt and Pepper Fried Fish Fillet

  1. Coat the tilapia in cornstarch and salt. Let it sit for 15 minutes to absorb the starch. 

  2. Heat a large skillet with half an inch of oil to 375-400°F.

  3. Work in batches and fry the fish for 5 minutes or until cooked through. Drain on a wire rack then pour all of the oil into a bowl.

  4. In the same skillet on medium high heat, sauté scallions and Thai red chilies for 30 seconds. Toss in the fish and season with black pepper, sugar, and salt to taste. 

## Tasty Tips

  * **Fry in batches** to prevent the oil temperature from dropping too much.
  *  **Once the fish is in the pan, do not flip it until halfway through cooking.** If you flip it too early, the crust may not have formed and will break the fish.
  *  **Adjust the cook time** depending on the fish you use and thickness. Test one by cutting it in half and look for an opaque and flaky center. 
  * **Add some aromatics like ginger and garli** c. Try 1/2 teaspoon of each for some extra flavor!

## FAQs

**How do I store leftover salt and pepper fried fish?**

Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

**How do I reheat leftovers?**

I love using the air fryer to reheat since it crisps up the fish. Reheat at
350°F for 5 minutes or until heated through. You can also reheat by frying
again, in the oven or even the microwave if you don't mind a soft coating.

**Can I make this ahead of time?**

Yes, you can make this ahead of time and reheat as instructed above, but it's
best served immediately.
