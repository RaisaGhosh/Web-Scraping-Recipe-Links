## Ingredients

Serves: 2-3 people

### Main Ingredients

  * 2 pieces fish fillet (use white fish - tilapia, snapper, etc) 
  * 3 cloves garlic 
  * 4 bird eyes chillies 
  * 1 tsp ginger (chopped) 
  * 1 stalk spring onion (chopped) 
  * ½ tsp sugar 
  * Salt and pepper (to taste) 
  * A dash of Shaoxing wine 
  * Cooking oil (for deep-frying) 

### Fish Marinade

  * 1 tbsp of Shaoxing wine 
  * ½ tsp salt 
  * ½ tsp pepper 
  * 1 egg white 
  * 2 tbsp corn flour 

## Directions

### To Cook

  1. Rinse and pat dry fish fillets with a paper towel. Cut fish into bite-size pieces and mix well with marinade ingredients. Set aside for 10-15 mins.
  2. Fill a frying pan 3-4 cm deep with cooking oil. Deep-fry the fish (in batches) on high heat until golden brown. Drain the fried fish on paper towel.
  3. When you're done frying, pour out the remaining oil and leave about 2 tbsp oil in the pan. On medium high heat, saute the ginger, garlic and chilli until fragrant. Then, add salt, pepper and sugar.
  4. Add in the fried fish, a dash of Shaoxing wine and give it a few quick tosses. Sprinkle chopped spring onions and serve warm.
