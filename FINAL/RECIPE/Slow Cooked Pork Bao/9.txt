# RECIPE: Hoisin and ginger pulled pork bao buns

Updated: Apr 28, 2020

**If you find yourself going straight to the bao buns when you see them on a
menu, you 'll love this week's recipe that our executive chef, Steve Barton
(AKA Chef), has provided as something to do while we're all still encouraged
to hunker down at home.**

A fan favourite that conveniently looks great on the 'gram; this hoisin and
ginger pulled pork bao bun recipe even includes how to make your own (plain)
bao buns if you're one of the lucky ones who has got a supply of flour and
sugar, or are just someone who fancies a challenge.

  

##  **Chef 's hoisin and ginger pulled pork bao buns**

  

 **INGREDIENTS**

Pulled pork

  * 3-3.5 kg pork shoulder (fat trimmed)

  * 2 tsp five spice powder

  * Salt & pepper

  * 1 tsp dried chilli flakes (can use smoked chilli flakes if you prefer)

  * 2 tsp grated fresh ginger - a 10 cm piece of ginger should produce this

  * 6 – 8 cloves garlic sliced

  * 300 ml hoisin sauce

  * 250 ml (1 cup) ginger beer

  

Slaw

  * 2 tbsp lime juice

  * 2 tbsp lemon juice

  * 2 tbsp rice vinegar

  * 1 tbsp sugar

  * 2 cups finely shredded cabbage

  

Other fillings

  * Fresh sliced cucumber

  * Pickled carrot

  * Fresh coriander

  * Hot sauce (optional)

  

Bao buns

  * Keep reading for how to make your own from scratch _or_ purchase from the freezer department of your local supermarket

  

 **METHOD**

Pulled pork

  * Rub the pork generously with the salt, pepper, five spice, chilli and ginger 

  * Place in the pot of a slow cooker* and allow to marinate for about an hour 

  * Pour over the hoisin sauce, ginger beer and add the garlic 

  * Turn the slow cooker onto low, cover and cook for about 8 – 9 hours depending on the size of your pork 

  * Once cooked, turn off and allow to cool

  * Remove the meat, place on a tray and shred _(it will literally pull part)_

  * Pour the sauce over it and keep anything left over in a pot for later if desired

  

 _*If you don 't have a slow cooker you can also prep your pulled pork in the
over. There are a lot of great websites out there that will help you work out
the best conversion in terms of cook time & heat needed_

  

Slaw

  * Mix all the dressing ingredients together and toss with the shredded cabbage

  

Bao buns

  * Either follow the directions on the pack of any store-bought buns or keep reading for how to make your own authentic ones

  

Finally...

  * Add sliced cucumber and pickled carrot to the bottom of the bao bun

  * Fill with pulled pork 

  * Add a drizzle of hot sauce if you like it spicy

  * Finish off with the dressed slaw and fresh coriander

  * Enjoy!

## **Authentic bao buns from scratch**

 **Making bao dough from scratch involves a bit more effort than simply
pulling some store bought ones out of the freezer & cooking them. **

  

However, as we've all got a bit of time on our hands and some of us are
enjoying spending that in the kitchen, Chef has shared his bao bun recipe for
you below:

  

 **INGREDIENTS**

  * 500g plain flour

  * 50g caster sugar

  * 1 tsp salt

  * 1 tsp baking powder

  * 1 tsp dried yeast

  * 150ml water

  * 100ml whole milk

  * 50ml double cream

  * 2 tbsp vegetable oil

  

 **METHOD**

  * Add yeast to the water in the bowl of a stand mixer and allow it to activate for about 10 minutes

  * Use the paddle attachment, add the rest of the ingredients and mix briefly until you have a dough

  * Scrape the paddle, attach the dough hook and continue kneading for about five minutes 

  * Remove from the bowl onto a floured surface and briefly knead to form a round dough ball that is springy to the touch

  * Place this in a greased bowl, cover with a sheet of greased cling film and allow the dough to prove in a warm place for about an hour _(it should double in size)_

  * Pinch back the risen dough on a floured surface and roll this into a log shape 

  * Divide this into 12 equal parts 

  * Roll each of these parts into a ball and place on a floured tray 

  * Cover with a tea towel and allow the dough to prove for a second time for around 30 minutes _(it should double in size again)_

  * While this is proving, cut out twelve 8cm x 8cm squares of baking paper 

  * Fill a steamer with water and set to STEAM

  * Roll a bun into an oval shape, dip a chopstick into a bottle of oil and fold the two pieces over this stick, which you then slide out 

  * Place this folded piece of dough on a piece of baking paper. _(Repeat with all 12 pieces)_

  * Steam the buns three at a time in the steamer for five minutes. They will be firm to the touch and cooked through _(repeat until they are all cooked)_
