Western.Chefs

##### Dec. 16, 2010

### Ingredients

| Fat/Salad oil  |  4 Tablespoon  
---|---|---  
| Finely minced onion  |  1/4 Cup (4 tbs)  
| Garlic  |  1 Clove (5 gm) , minced (Peeled)  
| Salt  |  1/2 Teaspoon  
| Pepper  |  1/2 Dash (1 Speck)  
| Worcestershire sauce  |  1 Teaspoon  
| Prepared mustard  |  1 Teaspoon  
| Chili sauce  |  2 Tablespoon  
  
### Directions

Combine fat, onion, and garlic in a saucepan, over low heat, and cook until
onion is tender—about 10 min., stirring frequently so as not to brown.

Add remaining ingredients, mix well, and heat.

Serve over hot cooked string beans, cabbage, spinach, or other greens, after
arranging in the serving dish.
