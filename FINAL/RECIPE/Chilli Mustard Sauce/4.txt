  3. This Hot Mustard Sauce Is About to Become Your New Favorite Condiment

# This Hot Mustard Sauce Is About to Become Your New Favorite Condiment

Caitlin Bensel

Yield

Serves 8 (serving size: 2 tsp.)

By Mary Claire Britton and Jamie Vespa, MS, RD

May 2018

If you love the spicy mustard that’s often paired with Chinese egg rolls, whip
up this tangy, cayenne-spiked mustard sauce. Whisk together this small batch,
or scale it up to make enough to have on hand for a couple weeks—it keeps well
in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Serve as a dip for chicken tenders or
grilled tofu “fingers” or drizzle it over roasted broccoli.

## Ingredients

  * 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
  * 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
  * 1 minced garlic clove
  * 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
  * 2 teaspoons honey
  * 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
