# Mandarin Chicken Salad

Our infatuation with canned mandarin oranges goes back to the time when our
firstborn, Sam, was a two-year-old who was exploring flavors and textures of
food. We'd freeze an entire can of mandarin oranges then feed her small
portions of the frozen fruit that we scraped with a teaspoon.

Sam still loves canned mandarin oranges to this day. She's not a toddler
anymore so we don't need to scrape frozen fruit for her. She adores vegetable
salad in just about every iteration but especially when segments of mandarin
oranges are tossed in.

### Ingredients

  

  * 2 cups cubed cooked chicken (see notes after the recipe)
  * roasted sesame salad dressing (available in Asian groceries)
  * 4 cups torn lettuce
  * 2 to 4 tomatoes cubed
  * 1 onion peeled and thinly sliced
  * 2 cups croutons
  * 1 ½ cups mandarin orange segments well drained if using canned
  * ½ cup roasted cashew nuts

### Instructions



  * Place the cubed chicken in a mixing bowl.

  * Drizzle in two tablespoons of salad dressing and toss well (this will flavor the chicken better especially if underseasoned).

  * Add the rest of the ingredients, add two tablespoons of salad dressing and toss.

  * Divide the mandarin chicken salad among four bowls.

  * Drizzle more salad dressing over the salad in the bowls before serving.

### Notes

The chicken can be boiled, grilled, roasted or poached. How it was cooked
before the meat was cut into cubes will affect the texture of the salad. The
best option is fire-grilled chicken which will give the salad a smoky aroma
and flavor. The second best option is rotisserie chicken.
