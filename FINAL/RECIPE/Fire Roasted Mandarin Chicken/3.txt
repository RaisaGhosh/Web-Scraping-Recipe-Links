This is very similar to the Mandarin chicken served in the malls, except I use
white meat chicken. Boneless chicken thighs are what the restaurant uses. It's
quick, easy and delicious. Sometimes I'll make this, then a quick trip to the
local Chinese take-out for vegetable lo mein and eggrolls for a cheap, tasty
Chinese meal that's almost homemade. You'll be amazed at how authentic this
tastes! *Note: I have adjusted the amount of sugar to reflect comments written
in reviews. If you like it sweet, use the full 2/3 cup.

I added orange oil and put a quarter of the sugar. Delicious! I also used the
same recipe for my tofu (since my family eats meat but I don't), it was just
as good. Thank you!

I was in a rush so didn't read the reviews. I added less than half the sugar
and even my sweet tooth kids thought it was disgustingly sweet. Sorry but I
ended up throwing it away and making everyone sandwiches.
