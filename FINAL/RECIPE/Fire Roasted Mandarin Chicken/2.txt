## Frequently Asked Questions:

**How to make mandarin chicken crispy without frying?**

The method is in the seasoning. Use cornflour to form a layer around chicken
pieces. Then fry it in a large nonstick pan that allows the chicken to
chocolate on each side before flipping.



As soon as the chicken is cooked, spread on the plate, make sure all the
pieces don't stick to each other. This will ensure they remain clear. If you
just pile up with each other, they start steaming and the layer will be moist.



Another tip is to cook it properly before you eat and serve immediately so you
can enjoy the crispy pieces of chicken. If the chicken sits in the sauce too
long, the layer will get wet.



If you crave Chinese people and want something very quickly, try chicken
Sichuan Chicken, made with chicken chili Sichuan ready to cook us. It's been
marinated, so what you have to do is throw it into the pan!



**What are the sizes of chicken pieces we can use for the Mandarin Chicken
Recipe?**

To make Chinese dishes at home, your best choice is boneless chicken breast or
boneless chicken thighs. They cook quickly because they are boneless and more
comfortable to eat. You can cut this into a cube or strip based on your
recipe. For this recipe, you will need a 1-inch chicken cube.
