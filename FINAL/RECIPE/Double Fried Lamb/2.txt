Chef Karen Akunowicz  
Myers + Chang  
Boston

Chef Akunowicz makes the most of a smaller portion of lamb by stretching it
into an Asian stir-fry to serve at Myers + Chang. Knowing that a lot of mutton
is eaten in Mongolia and Northern China, she made sure to perfume the dish
with cumin and coriander--two spices common in that region. The lamb belly is
crisped in a wok to turn it into "lamb bacon."

## Steps

## Tips

1\. For stir-fry sauce: In large saucepan, whisk soy sauce, vinegar, sesame
oil, pepper and ¼ cup water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low. In small
bowl, whisk together cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water until smooth to form a
slurry. Slowly add to soy mixture; whisk constantly. Increase heat to medium-
high; whisk until mixture thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Sauce should be shiny and
coat the back of a spoon. Remove sauce from heat; pour into a bowl or
container and refrigerate until cool. Sauce can be stored in an airtight
container in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.  
2\. For hot mustard sauce: In small bowl, whisk together vinegar, soy sauce,
sugar and sesame oil.  Add mustard powder; whisk vigorously until thoroughly
blended. Slowly drizzle in vegetable oil, whisking constantly, to emulsify
sauce.  It will be thick and shiny.  The sauce can be stored in an airtight
container in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.  
3\. For lamb belly bacon: In small saucepan, toast cinnamon stick, cumin,
coriander, red pepper flakes and peppercorns over low heat until fragrant, 3
to 4 minutes. Rub toasted spices over lamb belly. Sprinkle brown sugar and 3
tablespoons vinegar over lamb belly and rub in. Refrigerate, covered, in
nonreactive container or shallow glass baking dish for at least 24 hours or up
to 3 days.  
4\. Preheat oven to 350 F. In large braising dish or Dutch oven, scatter
celery, scallions, onions, carrot, garlic and ginger evenly on bottom. Lay
lamb belly directly on vegetables; evenly pour chicken broth, 1/2 cup black
vinegar and soy sauce over top.  Cover lightly with aluminum foil (or cover
with lid if using a Dutch oven). Place over high heat for 5 minutes.  
5\. Remove pan from stove; place in oven. Braise for 1½ hours; remove from
oven. When cool enough to handle, remove lamb and place on rack on baking
sheet to cool.  It will have shrunk to about half the original size and will
be very fragrant.  Discard vegetables and excess juice.  
6\. Once cool, wrap lamb tightly in plastic wrap; place in freezer until
completely cool and firm, about 15 minutes or up to 1 hour. Slice lamb belly
lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips resembling bacon. Slice strips into thirds;
set aside.  
7\. For stir-fry: Fill a large bowl with ice water; set aside. Fill a large
pot with water; bring to a rolling boil. Add beans; cook just until the color
changes, about 2 minutes for long beans and 1 minute for green beans. Quickly
remove beans from water with a slotted spoon or drain in a colander; plunge
beans into ice water to stop cooking. Remove cooled beans from water; pat dry
with paper towels and set aside.  
8\. Fill pot again with water; bring to rolling boil. Drop in noodles and turn
off heat. Let noodles soak for 8 minutes; drain. Toss with 1 tablespoon oil to
keep from sticking; set aside.  
9\. Heat a wok or large, heavy, flat-bottomed skillet over high heat; add 3
tablespoons oil. Add noodles; stir-fry until warm and develop a bit of char,
about 1 minute. Divide among 4 bowls.  
10\. In same wok or skillet over medium heat, lay half the sliced lamb belly
as flat as possible; cook until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted
spoon; place on a paper towel-lined plate.  
11\. To the lamb fat in the wok, add half the leeks; toss until they are soft,
about 1 minute. Add half the long beans; stir-fry 1 minute. Add half the
cabbage; stir-fry for another 1 minute. Return lamb belly bacon to the wok;
add about half the stir-fry sauce and toss for 1 minute. Add 2 tablespoons
Chinese hot mustard sauce; stir. Divide stir-fry between two bowls. Repeat
with remaining stir-fry ingredients to make two more bowls. Garnish with
cilantro and sesame seeds; serve immediately.
