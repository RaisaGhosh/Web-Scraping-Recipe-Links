## Steps

  * Preheat oven to 200C.
  * For the Butter Caramel Carrots, melt butter and oil together in a medium frypan over medium heat. Add carrot slices and cook until just softened, about 5 minutes. Add sugar and stir until dissolved. Remove from heat and gently toss carrots through the caramel to ensure they are evenly coated. Remove carrots and season to taste. Set aside, keeping warm, until needed. Reserve the pan with remaining butter caramel for the Lamb Shoulder.
  * For the Lamb Shoulder, place a large, flame-proof casserole dish on the stove top over high heat. Add the oil and the lamb pieces and brown on all sides. Add all remaining ingredients except for the molasses and stir to combine. Transfer the contents of the casserole dish to a pressure cooker, cover with lid and seal, and cook on high pressure for 40 minutes.
  * When cooked, release pressure, remove lamb pieces and set aside to rest for 10 minutes. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine sieve, place in a clean bowl and set side for the Lamb Sauce.
  * Place fry pan of reserved butter caramel back onto the heat. Add lamb pieces and gently turn to coat, being careful not to break up the lamb. Caramelise on each side. Add the molasses to the pan and use a pastry brush to baste lamb pieces with the molasses mixture and coat all sides. Remove from heat and set aside, keeping warm, until needed.
  * For the Lamb Sauce, place lamb bones into a heavy based, flame-proof roasting dish and roast in the oven, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove tray from oven and place on the stove top over medium heat. Add onion, carrot and anchovies and stir well until caramelised. Deglaze with pinot noir and cook for 2 minutes to enhance sweetness. Stir to loosen sediments on the bottom of the pan. Add chicken stock and red wine vinegar and reduce heat to low. Simmer until slightly reduced, about 20 minutes.
  * Strain sauce through a fine sieve into a clean, medium sized saucepan and place back over medium heat, continuing to simmer, until reduced by half, about 5-10 minutes. Add Dijon mustard and 1 cup of the reserved strained pressure cooker liquid and reduce on the heat to a slightly thickened sauce consistency, about 5 minutes.
  * Stir in butter, 1 cube at a time, until melted. Season to taste and set aside, keeping warm, until needed to serve.
  * For the Purée, place macadamia nuts, onions, garlic, milk, salt and pepper into a small saucepan over high heat. Add enough water to ensure all ingredients are fully submerged. Bring to the boil, then reduce heat and simmer until onion, nuts and garlic are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and strain into a clean bowl, reserving solids.
  * Place solids into a stick blender canister and blitz with a stick blender until smooth, adding a little reserved cooking liquid to loosen if required. Pass the purée through a fine sieve and return to a clean, small saucepan over low heat. Simmer, stirring continuously, until completely soft, about 10 minutes. Add butter, 1 cube at a time, until melted and thoroughly combined. Season to taste then blitz with a stick blender until completely smooth. Set aside, keeping warm, until needed.
  * For the Pickled Onions, place vinegar, sugar and salt into a saucepan over low heat and stir until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and add the sliced onion, ensuring onion is fully submerged in pickling liquid. Set aside to pickle for 15 minutes.
  * For the Pickled Beetroots, use a 3cm cookie cutter to cut the slices of beetroot into discs. You should be able to cut 3 x 3cm discs from each slice of beetroot. Place remaining ingredients into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Add beetroot discs, reduce to low heat and simmer until just soft, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat, strain and set aside until needed.
  * To serve, place 2 – 3 spoonsful of the Purée into the middle of each serving plate. Arrange some Pickled Beetroot slices, Butter Caramel Carrots and Pickled Onion to each dish, on top of the purée. Top with a piece of glazed Lamb Shoulder. Garnish each dish with some nasturtium leaves and rosemary flowers. Serve warm Sauce on the side.
