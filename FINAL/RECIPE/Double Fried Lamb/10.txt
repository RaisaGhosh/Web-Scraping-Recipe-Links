##  Ingredients

Deselect All

2 racks of lamb (8 bones per rack; about 2 pounds each), trimmed and frenched
by your butcher

2 cups plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

10 sprigs rosemary, 8 stripped and roughly chopped and 2 whole, plus more for
garnish

10 sprigs oregano, 8 roughly chopped and 2 whole, plus more for garnish

6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced

1 tablespoon Aleppo pepper (or 3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes)

Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

Flaky sea salt, for topping

##  Directions

  1. Cut each rack of lamb into 4 double chops of even thickness. Stir together 2 cups olive oil, the chopped rosemary and oregano, the garlic and 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper (or 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes) in a large bowl. Add the lamb chops, bones up, and rub the mixture evenly over the meat. Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight. 
  2. Preheat the oven to 400Àö. Remove the lamb from the refrigerator and wipe off any excess marinade with a paper towel. Season generously with kosher salt and a few grinds of pepper. 
  3. Heat an extra-large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and heat until shimmering. Add the lamb, rounded fat‚Äìside down. Cook until well browned, about 4 minutes. Turn the chops on their sides in the skillet and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Turn the chops so the fat side is facing up and cook 2 to 3 more minutes. (It‚Äôs OK if some of the bones are sticking out of the skillet to make space.) Carefully pour off the fat from the skillet and transfer the skillet to the oven. Roast until a thermometer inserted into the center of the lamb registers 125Àö for medium-rare to medium doneness, 5 to 7 minutes. 
  4. Return the skillet to the stovetop over medium-high heat; add the butter and rosemary and oregano sprigs to an open space in the pan. Let the butter melt and start to foam, then baste the chops with the butter a few times until well coated. 
  5. Transfer the chops to a platter and top with any remaining butter from the skillet. Sprinkle with flaky salt and the remaining 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper (or 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes). Garnish with rosemary and oregano sprigs. 

### Cook's Note

Ask your butcher for two ‚Äúfrenched‚Äù racks of lamb, which means the fat is
scraped off the bones for a nicer presentation. You can also ask the butcher
to cut the racks into chops. Marinating isn‚Äôt essential but it‚Äôs a good idea
if you want to minimize lamb‚Äòs slight gaminess. This marinade adds so much
flavor, there‚Äôs no need for a sauce or condiment. Sear the chops in a skillet
to give them color and flavor, then roast in the oven until the internal
temperature reaches 125Àö. Lamb is lean and can become tough, so be careful not
to overcook it.
