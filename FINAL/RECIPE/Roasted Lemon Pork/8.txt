## Why we love it

Pork chops sometimes have a reputation for being bland, but it all depends on
the marinade and the cooking. With lemon pork chops, you can make a quick and
delicious dinner, without much effort.

Add a few mushrooms in there at the right time, and you have a one dish meal
from the oven that will add a ton of flavor and protein while making it less
of a hassle to clean up.

Pork chops before cooking

The key to cooking pork chops is making sure the pork is cooked but not
overcooked or dry. The pork chops shouldn't be pink, because that would mean
they are undercooked, and you will risk getting sick. Don't hesitate to check
on the meat and cut a portion of it towards to end to see at what point it is
cooking.

You can also use a meat thermometer to make sure your chop is perfectly cooked
which is around 145° F (62°C).

## Frequently asked questions

### 1\. What to serve with it?

Lemon pork chops with mushrooms goes quite well with plain white rice or
quinoa. You can also serve it with mashed,  
scalloped, or au gratin potatoes, steamed broccoli, roasted carrots, green
beans, etc.

### 2\. Can you prepare it in advance?

Yes, cooked lemon pork should keep in the freeze, as long as you keep it in an
airtight container. After 2-3 months, the pork may still be safe to eat, but
its texture and flavor may not be as good.

I don't recommend freezing the mushrooms however, they will likely absorb
moisture and not taste as good.

  * 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
  * 2 teaspoons garlic powder 
  * 1 teaspoon paprika 
  * 1 teaspoon of dried basil 
  * 1-2 sprigs of fresh parsley 
  * pinch of salt and pepper

  5. Chop the mushrooms and the parsley. 
  6. Take out of the oven and add the chopped mushrooms and parsley into the same tray. 
  7. Toss the mushrooms lightly so that the sauces from the pork cover the mushrooms.
