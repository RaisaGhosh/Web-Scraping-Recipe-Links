Here is a step-by-step preparation of ginger chicken recipe:

  1. Take the chicken cubes in a bowl, add the ginger paste, salt, and Kashmiri chilli powder to it. Mix everything until well incorporated and set it aside to marinate for at least 15 to 20 minutes.
  2. Heat a pan and allow the cumin and coriander seeds to roast on a medium flame. This process should take about 2-3 minutes as you need to dry roast it until the spices turn aromatic. Once cooled, transfer them to a clean and dry blender jar and powder them.
  3. Heat two tablespoons of oil in a kadhai. Once the oil is hot, add the marinated chicken to it and cook them on high flame for about 2 minutes or until they change their colour. Flip them over and let it cook on the other side.
  4. Take the chicken out of the pan and let it rest in a tissue-lined plate.
  5. In the same kadhai, add the remaining oil and heat it. Add the onions and fry them for about 8-12 minutes, or until they turn soft and brown. The secret to a perfect ginger chicken recipe lies in the perfect caramelisation of onions, so be patient at this step.
  6. Now, add the green chilli paste, a tablespoon of the cumin-coriander powder, turmeric, black pepper, red chilli, and salt. Saute everything for about a minute.
  7. Pour in the tomato puree and let everything fry for at least 7 to 10 minutes on medium flame. Keep sauteeing the gravy until the tomato water has dried and the gravy exudes and separates from the oil.
  8. Add the pieces of cooked chicken and mix everything. Once it has incorporated with the bhuna masala, mix the whipped yoghurt to the ginger chicken recipe.
  9. Turn the flame to low and allow the gravy to simmer for 8 to 15 minutes until it reaches the desired consistency (runny if you are having with rice and thick if you are having it with roti, paratha, or naan). Keep stirring the curry occasionally.
  10. Once gravy looks cooked, take it off the heat and throw in the tablespoon of butter on top.
  11. Finally, garnish the murgh adraki by sprinkling some ginger juliennes and coriander leaves on top. Also, add a dash of garam masala. Serve hot with rice or Indian bread.

### Variations of Ginger Chicken Recipe

While the flavours in the above ginger chicken recipe are purely Indian, you
can customize it to change its origin. Consider the following examples:

  * Eliminating tomatoes and marinating the chicken in soy sauce and rice wine vinegar will allow you to cook a Chinese version of the ginger chicken recipe. In this recipe, you may even coat the chicken in cornflour.
  * Stir fry some mushrooms, scallions, ginger, garlic, chicken in a wok, add some soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and salt. Pour in coconut milk and add a touch of galangal and kaffir lime - you have your Thai version ready.



The above ginger chicken recipe packs quite a flavourful punch. If you wish to
enhance its taste and healthfulness, then you should make use of organic
ingredients. Organic products have an authentic taste and contain no
additives. Similarly, make use of antibiotics-free, free-range chicken to add
value and nutrition to the ginger chicken recipe.
