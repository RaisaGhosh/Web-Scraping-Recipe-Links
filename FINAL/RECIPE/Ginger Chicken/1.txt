Heat oil in a cooking pot and add chicken in it. Stir fry till chicken starts
turning white. Add salt and further stir fry till chicken completely turns
white from pink.

that chicken is well coated with spices. Now pour the tomatoes and milk
mixture.

4.

In the same blender's jug, put 1 1/2 cups water. Cover the lid and shake well
so that the sides are washed.

5.

Now pour this water in chicken and mix. Increase flame to high and bring a
boil. Add in the ginger julienne. Mix, cover and cook on medium heat, stirring
occasionally till chicken is cooked.

6.

Remove cover and reduce water on high heat till the gravy gets a little
thickened and leaves oil on sides.

7.

Enjoy hot with chapati/bread .
