These flavours take me back to my childhood, when my mother used to make a
stuffed crab that I loved. She would take the meat out, boil the shell, stuff
the meat back in, top it with cheese and bake it. Mine is a more refined
version: I have loosely borrowed her recipe to make a pasta with similar
flavours, and added a touch of Indianness with the baby shrimp pickle.

  * 50 ml white wine
  * Salt and pepper

### Preparation

#### For Making Pasta Dough

  1. Mix flour, semolina, salt and olive oil in a bowl with both hands, using your fingertips lightly. Mound up the flour, making a well in the centre.
  2. In another bowl, break two eggs, add in saffron and whisk well.
  3. Toss the beaten egg into flour well and add saffron. 
  4. Slowly combine all the ingredients together, kneading them into a dough. It should be firm and pliable, with a slight springiness to the touch. You can add a few drops of water and continue to knead if dough is too dry.
  5. Wrap it with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours.

#### For Crab Stuffing

  1. Sauté all ingredients – except crab meat and lemon juice – in a pan on medium heat, till they soften and are well combined.
  2. Remove from pan and set aside in a nonreactive bowl to cool.
  3. Once cool, add in crab meat and lemon juice, mix well, and refrigerate before using for pasta stuffing.

#### For Crab Ravioli

  1. With a pasta roller, roll out pasta dough into sheets 1 mm thick and approximately 60 cm (2 feet) long.
  2. Spoon 1 teaspoon-sized dollop of crab stuffing and repeat, creating two rows, down half the length of the sheet, evenly spaced from each other and the sheet edges.
  3. You should ideally fit 10 balls of filling in two rows of five each down half the pasta sheet.
  4. Next, carefully fold the uncovered half of pasta sheet over and onto the crab filling side to cover the mounds. Push down around the filling with your fingers to seal.
  5. Use a fluted (or plain) dough cutter to cut squares around the filling. The squares should be about 1-2 cm greater than the size of the mounds of filling.
  6. Trim away excess dough from the sheet to be reused for making more sheets.
  7. Transfer crab raviolis to a tray dusted with semolina or flour and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate till ready to cook.
  8. When ready to cook, boil a large pot of lightly salted water and cook for 2-3 minutes or till they start to float up. Remove, drain and toss in olive oil.

#### For Chili Shrimp & Crab Claws

  1. In a pan, sauté garlic, herbs and spices in olive oil on high heat till garlic starts browning.
  2. Add in unpeeled baby shrimp and cracked crab claws with tomato paste and sauté some more, agitating the pan contents constantly to prevent burning or sticking.
  3. After a couple of minutes, add in white balsamic vinegar and sauté till the vinegar evaporates. Adjust seasoning and set aside to cool.

#### For Bell Pepper Cream Sauce

  1. Combine all ingredients, making sure to cover the peppers, tomatoes and onions thoroughly with the olive oil, herbs, salt and pepper.
  2. Put them all on a foil-covered tray and roast in the oven at 180℃/350℉ for about 30 minutes till the skins of the tomatoes and peppers char and blister.
  3. Remove from the oven and let cool. Peel off the skin and discard the seeds, but save whatever pan juices remain. Put everything in a blender and purée to a smooth paste. Set aside.
  4. Sauté onion and garlic in butter in a pan on medium heat, till they turn translucent. 
  5. Pour in white wine and then the roasted bell pepper paste, and cook till the wine evaporates.
  6. Next pour in the vegetable stock, lower the heat and simmer. Spoon in the cream and continue to cook, reducing it further.
  7. Finish with grated Parmesan cheese and herbs.

#### To Serve

  1. While you’re finishing red bell pepper sauce, cook the ravioli in a pot of slow-boiling salted water. They will float to the top when done. This should take about 3-4 minutes.
  2. Remove from water and drain. Gently toss the ravioli in red pepper cream sauce.
  3. Finish with chopped parsley and a spoonful of chilli prawn and crab claw.
