#  Stir-fried crab claws with spring onion, chilli and garlic

by

Andy Waters

  * Starter
  * easy
  * 4 
  * 30 minutes

PT30M

Crab claws look particularly impressive as a starter, and once released, the
delicate flesh works particularly well with the Asian flavours used in Andy
Waters' recipe. Chilli, garlic, ginger, fish sauce and coriander add plenty of
punch, and this recipe is quick and easy to throw together.
