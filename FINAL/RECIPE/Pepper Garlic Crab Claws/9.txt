# Garlic butter crab

Posted by  Magic Ingredient

I have always been apprehensive about cooking crabs. And somewhere deep down,
I was also scared. Recently, I put my fears to rest and bought a few crabs
home to make some delicious crab garlic butter.

Once you take the top shell off, you focus on cleaning all the dirt and
inedible stuff. The cleaner guy at the carrefour was kind enough to explain
how to clean crabs. Remember to use rubber gloves while cleaning the crabs. I
tend to remove the claws and leave the legs. The choice is yours. I would
suggest if your pan is small, take off the legs and feet.

I have eaten seafood, including crabs in Indian spices, and we love it.
However, I decided to try it a little differently this time. You will need
loads of garlic and butter.

We tried it over a lazy weekend afternoon during the summer break. Kiddo had
his pizza, and the adults enjoyed crabs with corn, sausages, and potatoes. It
was pretty messy, but we were happy. I hope you do try this easy recipe on the
weekend.

Recipe of garlic butter crab

**Preparation time:** 10-15 minutes  
 **Cooking time:** 15-20 minutes  
 **Serves:** 1-2

****Ingredients** **

  * Crabs 5 
  * Corn 1-2
  * Sausages 2
  * Sweet Potato 1/2 
  * Garlic 8-9 cloves
  * Paprika 1 tsp
  * Smoked paprika ¼ tsp
  * Cajun spice mix 1 tbsp
  * Salt and pepper
  * Butter 1/2 stick 
  * Olive oil 3 tbsp
  * Parsley 1 Tbsp (chopped)

**Method**

  1. Wash the crabs and place them in a pot of boiling water. Cook the crabs in seasoned boiling water for 10-15 minutes.
  2. Boil the corn, sweet potatoes and sausages until cooked through. 
  3. Heat a pan and add oil, butter, and garlic. Add paprika, chili flakes, smoked paprika, and cajun. Place the crabs along with the legs and toss to coat evenly. Add the salt and crushed black pepper. Allow the crab to simmer in the butter and spice mix for a few minutes. Use a spoon to pour the hot melted butter into the hollow. Turn off the heat and sprinkle chopped parsley. 
  4. Remove the crab, add the corn and sausages to the pan to get coated in the butter and spices. For the sweet potato slices I prefer shallow frying before tossing in the spic butter mix.
  5. Squeeze lemon and enjoy.
