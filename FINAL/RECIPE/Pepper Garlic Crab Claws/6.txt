Save Recipe

From the cookbook Spice It - given to me recently as a present by my ex
husband! I have developed a real love of crabs and am pretty handy at catching
and dispatching of them now days. It's a great way to fill in a few hours:
catching, cooking, cleaning and picking or eating them and makes me feel like
a real "hunter and gatherer"!

## ingredients

Nutrition

  * 3  tablespoons ketjap manis
  * 3  tablespoons oyster sauce
  * 3  tablespoons caster sugar
  * 2  kg raw blue swimmer crabs
  * 1 1⁄2 tablespoons oil
  * 1 1⁄2 tablespoons butter
  * 1 1⁄2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
  * 6  garlic cloves, finely chopped 
  * 1 -2  red chile, finely chopped 
  * 1 1⁄2 tablespoons black pepper
  * 1 1⁄2 teaspoons white pepper
  * 1⁄4 teaspoon ground coriander
  * 2  spring onions, finely chopped 
  * 1⁄4 cup chopped fresh coriander

## directions

  * Put kecap manis, oyster sauce, sugar and 3 tablespoons water in a small bowl, stir, then set aside. 
  * Pull back the apron of each crab, remove top shell, then intestines and feathery gills. Rinse quickly. 
  * Cut each crab into quarters and crack the legs gently (I use a meat mallet) so the flavours can enter. 
  * Heat the oil in a very large wok over high heat; add the crab pieces and stir fry in batches until the shell is bright orange and the meat almost cooked (about 5 minutes). Remove and repeat until all is cooked. 
  * Add the butter, ginger, garlic, chilli, black and white peppers and coriander to the wok; stir fry 30 seconds. 
  * Add the sauce mixture and stir; bring to the boil, then simmer 2 minutes. 
  * Return the crab to the wok and toss to coat in the sauce. 
  * Cook a further 2-3 minutes to finish cooking the crab then garnish with the spring onions and coriander leaves. 
  * Serve at once.

WOW...I love thie recipe and i cooked with 3kgs of blue swimmer crabs and it
was an absolute rewarding dish with tons of compliments. I doubled the black
pepper sauce recipe as I liked more sauce on my crabs. My heartfelt of thanks
to the Chef JustJanS.
