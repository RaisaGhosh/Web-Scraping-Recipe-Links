Sometimes the messiest recipes are the most satisfying to eat. Chunky crab
claws are given a lick of smoke then tossed with an intense sauce, which will
have you licking your fingers and asking for extra napkins. You can also cook
the crab claws on a griddle pan, but the smoke of a barbecue infuses the meat
with bags of flavour.
