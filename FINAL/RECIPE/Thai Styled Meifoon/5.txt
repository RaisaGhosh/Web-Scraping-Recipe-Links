Disgusting! I finally decided to try this recipe and it doesn’t even taste
close to what you get at a Chinese restaurant! My daughter took a bite and
started gagging.... never again

With all due respect... # 1. Per Wikipedia, sesame oil has virtually the same
smoke point as corn oil. # 2. Ingredient #2 IS sesame oil. # 3. Nowhere in
this recipe does it say to BOIL the noodles? You are instructed to SOAK them
in a pot of water. Perhaps the author should have used the term “bowl”? Love
the bullion idea!

Sesame oil should not be used to stir fry. It has a low smoke point and can
burn and taste bitter. It should be used as a finishing oil only, added after
everything else is cooked. Use a neutral tasting oil with a high smoke point
for the stir frying - like corn or canola oil.

It was delicious! I used carrots, broccoli stems cut very thin, eggs, garlic,
scallops, crushed red peppers, soy sauce and salt & pepper...that's it and it
was very simple to make.
