**Pepper Mushroom Stir Fry Recipe** is a super quick and simple recipe, thats
healthy and can be combined with a paratha or a bread to complete a weeknight
dinner. I have used button mushrooms in this recipe as i felt they work best
in absorbing flavors and also retaining its shape. You can experiment with a
lot of other ingredients by adding red bell peppers, or green capsicum or even
carrot wedges.

Serve the **Pepper Mushroom Stir Fry** along with Phulkas, Tomato Rasam and
Steamed Rice for a lunch or dinner.

## How to make Pepper Mushroom Stir Fry Recipe

  1. To begin making the Pepper Mushroom Stir Fry Recipe, wash and prepare the mushrooms and keep the rest of the ingredients ready.

  2. Heat a wok or a kadai on medium high heat; add a tablespoon of oil. Add in the ginger, green chillies and capsicum and stir fry for about a minute until the bell peppers get slightly tender. Add in the mushrooms and stir fry on high heat until the mushroom are lightly cooked.

  3. Once the mushrooms begin to cook too much, they will release a lot of water. If they do, then you will have to evaporate the water while you keep stirring them on the heat.

  4. Add in the remaining ingredients like turmeric, pepper powder, salt, garam masala and crushed black pepper and stir fry for a few more minutes and turn off the heat.
