# Mushroom Pepper Fry

mushroom pepper fry - a quick appetizer, learn how to make mushroom pepper fry

mushroom pepper fry

My son, Nehal, is extremely fond of mushrooms. I usually make a restaurant
style appetizer mushroom dish for him. One of his favorite restaurant dish is
mushroom pepper fry. The earthy flavor of the mushrooms pairs beautifully with
the sweet green peppers while black pepper adds a hint of spice. It can be
served as a starter or a side with roti, either way it makes for a comforting
stir fry. Not only is it filling but light on the stomach. Do not over cook
the mushrooms, lightly saute them till soft. And you'd want to cook them just
before serving as the dish tastes best, hot off the stove. Coriander leaves
make for a great garnish. And I must tell you that this stir fry is addictive.

Antioxident rich mushrooms are low fat, gluten free and full of nutrition.
Mushrooms cook very quickly, absorb flavors wonderfully and its meaty texture
makes it a great vegetarian alternative to meat.
