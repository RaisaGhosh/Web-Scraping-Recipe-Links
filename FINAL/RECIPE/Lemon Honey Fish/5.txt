This **honey lemon salmon** recipe has tender, melt-in-your-mouth pan-fried
salmon with a sticky sweet lemon & butter glaze. It's quick and easy to make!

Can't get enough of the salmon and honey combo? You'll love this Honey Mustard
Salmon.

I made this recipe shortly after my Honey Soy Sauce Glazed Salmon. I wanted to
try a sweet lemony sauce since salmon and lemon are a match made in heaven. It
uses a similar technique to that recipe. You simply pan fry the salmon for a
few minutes on both sides and then make a really quick sauce that thickens up
fast due to the cornstarch in it.

This pan seared honey lemon salmon is crispy on the outside and tender on the
inside... just the way salmon should be. ðŸ˜‰

## Recipe notes & tips:

  * **Searing salmon success tips:  **
    * Let the fish warm up for 15-20 minutes prior to starting the recipe if you can, and pat it dry before adding the salt & pepper. This helps it not stick to the pan.
    * Ensure the pan gets nice and HOT before you add the salmon.
    * Let the salmon cook undisturbed. Resist the urge to move it around the pan.
    * When you go to flip the salmon, if it's sticking, give it a little more time to release naturally.
    * Most salmon fillets (Atlantic salmon in particular) that you buy from the grocery store will be around 1" thick, and the cooking time in the recipe below will work, but in general it's a good idea to **watch the color of the salmon change** (the light pink color moves up slowly as it cooks) - this will give you an idea of how close it is to being done. It will still cook for a little bit after you take it off the heat. It's easy to overcook salmon, so keep that in mind.
  * You may want to use a splatter guard for easier clean-up, and I like to use kitchen tongs to easily flip the salmon.
  * If you have any leftovers, the salmon is actually pretty good cold in a salad! Leftovers will keep for 2-3 days in the fridge.

## What to serve with honey lemon glazed salmon?

White rice (I'm partial to jasmine) is delicious, but it would also go well
with pasta, mashed potatoes, or a salad.

### Ingredients



  * â–¢ 1 pound fresh salmon cut into 4 pieces
  * â–¢ Salt & pepper to taste
  * â–¢ 1 tablespoon olive oil
  * â–¢ 2 tablespoons butter divided

#### Sauce:

  * â–¢ 1/4 cup honey
  * â–¢ 2 tablespoons chicken broth or water
  * â–¢ 2 tablespoons lemon juice
  * â–¢ 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
  * â–¢ 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch

### Instructions



  * Take the salmon out of the fridge 15-20 minutes prior to starting the recipe if you can. Cut the salmon into 4 equal pieces and pat it dry with paper towel. Season generously with salt & pepper.

  * Add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. Let the pan heat up for a few minutes. 

  * Meanwhile, add the sauce ingredients to a medium bowl and whisk it together. Set aside.

  * Cook the salmon (skin-side down) for 5 minutes, then reduce the heat to medium and flip the fish over and cook for another 2-3 minutes (should be almost cooked through). 

  * Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter to the skillet and let it melt, then pour in the sauce (just pour it in between the salmon pieces). Let it bubble/thicken for 30 seconds or so, and then take the pan off the heat (the pan will still be hot and the sauce will continue to thicken, but this avoids burning it). Flip the salmon over & spoon the sauce over it.

  * Before serving, I like to squeeze some extra lemon juice over the salmon (I just use one wedge of lemon). This adds more lemony freshness and balances the sweetness. _The salmon skin goes nice and crispy and is delicious when you eat it right away, but it'll easily peel off if you prefer not to eat it._

### Notes

  * The salmon I used in this recipe was about 1" thick. If your salmon is thicker or thinner, you may need to adjust cooking time a bit.
  * It's ok if you've got a bit over a pound of salmon, just make sure it's not too much over or the salmon pieces will be crowded in the pan and not cook properly.

Should the salmon be cooked in a non-stick pan, or would a stainless or cast
iron work?

Any would work.

Coming from a recipe fail the night before, this was a sure fire winner! The
salmon was delectable- seriously so easy but delish! I served it with garlic
bacon green beans and jasmine rice like you suggested. I doubled the recipe
since I had more like 8 pieces of salmon to cook and it turned out so well.

I just made this tonight and I couldnâ€™t be more pleased! My mother thought it
was delicious. My roommate said I outdid myself and said it was outstanding!!
It really came together quickly. Thank you. I served it with roasted Brussel
sprouts and roasted sweet potato wedges.

This recipe was so easy to follow and cook. The tips on how to cook the salmon
allows it not be dry (which is a common consequence when using salmon).  
The honey lemon sauce was amazing not too sweet or sour, and a combination I
would never think of using (outside of my winter tea).  
This is a recipe I will share with my family (have a few picky eaters for
cousins).

I loved it.

Absolutely delicious - I struggle to find easy ways to make salmon tasty, and
this recipe did the trick. Purchasing good quality honey is key. Canâ€™t wait to
make it again!

This teeters between a 2 1/2 and 3 stars for me. The glaze was pretty thick
and a little on the sweet side. I think if I made it again Iâ€™d decrease the
amount of honey and cornstarch as well as possibly add some chili flakes or
fresh chili for some heat. I very much enjoyed the cooking method of the
salmon. The skin was crispy and the fish moist. This will be my new go to
method for making salmon.

Far too sweet for my family's taste. Made double the sauce and served half
with chicken breasts for our non-fish eater and he didn't love it either. darn
it!

That's too bad. Did you add the extra lemon juice as suggested?

Loveee this recipe! I have been looking for fish recipes for my mom who
recently had to eliminate chicken and beef from her diet. I stumbled across
this fun recipe, made it for her, and she has been asking me to make it for
her every day since. Highly recommend!
