# Easy Honey Garlic Salmon

Jump to Recipe Print Recipe

## Easy Honey Garlic Salmon is a throw together recipe in one pan and a
handful of ingredients!

A perfect sweet and savoury 5-ingredient garlicky sauce with a hint of lemon
will become your family's new salmon obsession. Honey Garlic Salmon = dinner
ready in under 15 minutes, including prep time!

It's no secret you all are loving this Browned Butter Honey Garlic Salmon two
years after first posting it way back when Cafe Delites was still a baby. With
the success of this video on Facebook, a few readers have been writing in
asking if there is any possible way to avoid browning butter.

This Salmon Recipe is it.

## Salmon

The browned butter mixed through that honey garlic sauce is what makes that
salmon recipe stand out from the rest. However, there comes a time when people
want to keep things simple, and there's nothing wrong with simplifying a
recipe! In fact, you guys are going to love this one if not more than the
previous one.

## Pan Seared Salmon

This salmon gets cooked right in the sauce. There's no searing or frying
first. Why? Because a lot of people get anxiety at the thought of frying then
flipping salmon and having the fillets fall apart on them halfway through
cooking. _Q. But how do I get the same crispy edges from searing?_ A. Once the
salmon is half way done, you're going to broil your fillets for a couple more
minutes (or grill them if you're in Australia) for that extra golden, crispy
and caramelised finish.

## Sauce For Salmon

This recipe is perfect for when you have no idea what to cook. Grab some
salmon fillets and rest assured you possibly have all of the sauce ingredients
in the pantry or refrigerator already.

  1. Butter? ‚úîÔ∏è
  2. Garlic? ‚úîÔ∏è
  3. Honey? ‚úîÔ∏è
  4. Soy Sauce? ‚úîÔ∏è
  5. Lemons? ‚úîÔ∏è

For a stronger lemon flavoured salmon, add the wedges into the pan when your
sauce is bubbling (the peel provides all of the flavour this way). For a
milder flavour, leave them out. Make this Easy Honey Garlic Salmon for your
dinner table tonight!

PRINT SAVE go to your favorites

Prep: 10 mins

Cook: 10 mins

Total: 20 mins

Serves: 4 people

### Ingredients

  * 4 wild caught salmon fillets about 1/2 pound or 250 grams each, skin off or on
  * Salt and pepper, to season
  * 1/2 teaspoon paprika (mild, sweet or smokey)
  * 2 tablespoons butter
  * 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or minced
  * 4 tablespoons honey
  * 1 tablespoon water
  * 2 teaspoons soy sauce
  * 1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon juice, (plus extra to serve)
  * Lemon wedges to serve

### Instructions

  * Arrange oven shelf to the middle of your oven. Preheat oven to broil/grill settings on medium heat. 

  * Season salmon with salt, pepper and paprika. Set aside.

  * Heat the butter in a skillet or pan over medium-high heat until melted. Add the garlic and saut√© for about a minute, until fragrant. Pour in the honey, water and soy sauce; allow the flavours to heat through and combine. Add in the lemon juice; stir well to combine all of the flavours together.

  * Add the salmon steaks to the sauce in the pan; cook each fillet (skin-side down if there's any skin) for 3-4 minutes or until golden, while basting the tops with the pan juices. Season with salt and pepper, to taste (if desired).

  * Optional -- Add the lemon wedges around the salmon (adds a stronger lemon taste). 

Baste salmon one more time then transfer the pan to your oven to broil / grill
for a further 5-6 minutes, or until the tops of the salmon are nicely charred,
and the salmon is cooked to your liking.  

  * To serve, drizzle with the sauce and a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve with steamed vegetables; over rice or with a salad.

Just did exactly that tonight and it was awesome. My filets were thick, so I
turned them on their sides as well as skin side and flesh side, basting
whenever turned. Might be difficult to keep the filets from falling apart if
cooked without the skin. This is already my favorite. Oven was totally
unnecessary, IMO.

My go-to recipe for the sockeye salmon we get in our Moink box! It always
turns out excellent. The only things I do differently are sautee the garlic
for about 30 seconds instead of a minute, add an extra tablespoon of water
where I don't use lemon juice with mine, and sear the salmon in the pan skin-
side up for half the time, skin down the other half because it gives a more
consistent glaze for me without the white protein oozing out the top. The best
part is that you can easily take this recipe and sprinkle in some crushed red
pepper for an impromptu firecracker salmon copycat!

This was out of the park delicious. I've been trying to find a good salmon
recipe I can do in the oven, because I traditionally grill it on a cedar
plank, but don't always have a plank available. This was by far the best
Salmon preparation I've had. Better than I've ever had in any restaurant! My
whole family raved about it, and I have picky children who only eat about 4
different things, so that's saying a lot. Thanks, this is a definite keeper!

Side note for those who said the sauce hardened or dried up: Odds are much of
it evaporated while it was on the stove-top. When you add the garlic, you
should saute for a max of 30 seconds before adding the other wet ingredients,
and as soon as it's all mixed together, add the salmon immediately. Even an
additional 30 seconds in a hot cast iron will quickly reduce your sauce, so if
you are left with just a thin layer when it hits the oven, then that's why
it's drying out. The only other problem may be the size of your salmon pieces.
If they're not filling your pan pretty snugly, then you're going to get a
quicker evaporation, and end up with the same problem. I had 4 nice big
fillets that left us with a wonderful sauce at the end which we were literally
pouring over our rice and mopping up with each bite. It was incredible!

I think you‚Äôre spot on with by the sauce can dry out/ harden. I realised too
late I‚Äôd used a pan that was too big, so lost all the sauce volume on the
stove top then it caramelised too far under the grill. Next time I‚Äôll try a
smaller pan and maybe transfer the sauce to keep warm on the side before I put
the salmon under the grill. I can‚Äôt wait to try again for the yummy sauce
everyone describes!

Wow! I made this tonight and it was a huge hit! It looked just like your

the sauce! The only restaurant that has this beat is Cheddars. Its the same
but I think they added bourbon. I will definitely make this again and
recommend it! THANK YOU!!!

I made this recipe twice and I loved it. However, both times the honey garlic
glaze would burn/solidify when I put it in the oven to broil. The salmon comes
out perfect, but the glaze hardens up completely to the pan. You can adjust
the broil setting on my oven, so the first time I did the automatic heat it‚Äôs
set up at (500F) and the second time I lowered it to (450F) as I wasn‚Äôt sure
what ‚Äúmedium broil‚Äù constituted in your recipe‚Ä¶ but both times, same thing
happened so I can‚Äôt baste it once it‚Äôs out of the oven. Any thoughts?

This was so easy and delicious. The only thing I did different besides omit
the water was the method. In my small kitchen, all my stovetop burners were in
use. I put the butter in a cast iron pan in a 425 degree oven to melt with the
garlic, then took it out and added the rest of the ingredients. Now, having a
burner available, I put it on the stovetop on med hi briefly until it bubbled,
then put the salmon in the pan, skin side up and put it in the oven for about
4 min. Took it out of the oven and the skin peeled off nicely, then flipped it
over, put it in the oven to cook for an additional 3ish minutes. Perfect. No
basting required. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Yes, you can bake it in the oven on a sheet pan. The flavor may not be as

it from drying out. Let me know if you try it! I would love to hear how it

Me and my husband always just pan fry the salmon and have it as a "Japanese"

flavor of the salmon became boring. This recipe was a very welcome change. As
a side I did some mashed potatoes which were amazing with the leftover sauce.

I would probably leave out the garlic then. Sometimes the garlic powder can be
grainy and change the texture of the salmon. You are welcome to try it but it
is not necessary. Hope that helps and you enjoy this salmon!

I made this salmon for dinner tonight. It was so yummy. I mixed the sauce &
marinated the salmon it it then put in broiler. Best salmon dish I've made in
a long time. I also put it on top of couscous. Would DEF make again.

Just cooked this. Whole family very much enjoyed it.

Added a bit more soy sauce and lemon juice to the mixture to cut down a bit if
the sweetness.

Also, baked not broiled (broil is broken) and it came out great.

Will cook again!

What temperature is ‚Äúmedium‚Äù broil?

I can control my broil temperature on my stove. Some stoves cannot. I would
set it on broil and then move the rack to the middle to broil the salmon.

Made the honey garlic 5 ingredient salmon tonight. It was delicious! Only
question is where does the paprika come in?

That is great to hear! The Paprika is when you season the salmon with salt,
pepper, and paprika. Hope that helps answer your questions. Enjoy your
delicious salmon!

So I‚Äôm hoping my family will like it. I‚Äôve never cooked salmon before, ha. I
chose this recipe because I thought it‚Äôd be easy enough and it was. I think I
may have had my heat up to high because the sauce ended up burning a little
bit.

Good morning

I have already tried Lemon Garlic Butter Shrimp and creamy lemon parmesan
chicken. Both dishes were thoroughly enjoyed by myself and my husband. I have
now set up the weeks menu. These meals are so tasty and convenient and I will
most certainly be cooking these meals for any future dinner parties that I
hold. The fact that we know the nutrition table to each menu helps. I look
forward to many more recipes.
