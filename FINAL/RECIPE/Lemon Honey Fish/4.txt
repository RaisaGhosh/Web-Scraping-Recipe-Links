The combination of honey and lemon makes this fish taste deliciously
different. This is best if grilled over charcoal but if you are not quite fond
of charcoal grilling like me then you can grill it on pan with almost the same
taste.

Ready In:

    30mins

     2-4

I just tried this recipe earlier and my hubby loved it. But we baked it
instead of grilling. The flavors of the sauce were alive and full of texture.
The raisins were perfect for the citrus flavor of the sauce. Best of all it
was a healthy dish! Love it!
