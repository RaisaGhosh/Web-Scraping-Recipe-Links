Save Recipe

Citrus fruits go very well with chicken. Like my another dish "Crispy Orange
Chicken", it doesn't require extra oil to cook but uses chicken fat from the
thigh skin. After pan-frying and baking, the entire skin fat would come out.
You get not only crispy skin but also tender and delicious chicken thigh.
Plus, using real lemons to make sauce is a lot better than a packed product.
Who knows what's in it? Anyway, enjoy this recipe. I think you'll love it!
