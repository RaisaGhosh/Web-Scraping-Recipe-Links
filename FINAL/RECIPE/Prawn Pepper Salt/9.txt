# Chinese Salt & Pepper Prawns

__

Are you a shrimp / prawn person? Well, I am. They are so versatile and readily
available at most local markets and supermarkets, I find myself using them
whenever I need to whip up a quick meal. If you are not a fan of prawn, you
could try using squid, chicken or even tofu as your choice of protein.

  

How should I describe the flavor profile of these **Chinese Salt and Pepper
Prawns**? Crispy, spicy and garlicky ‚Äì you can‚Äôt really go wrong with these
three combinations. The numbing effect comes from Sichuan peppercorn, you
could add them according to your taste bud tolerance.

**Ingredients:**  
500 g prawns ‚Äì peeled, deveined, butterflied  
6 to 8 cloves garlic ‚Äì roughly chopped  
1 fresh chilli ‚Äì cut into chunks  
3 to 4 dried chilli ‚Äì cut into chunks  
2 stalks spring onion ‚Äì sliced  
1 tsp Sichuan peppercorn  
1 tbsp sea salt  
6 tbsp corn starch / potato starch  
Cooking oil

_Peel, devein and split the prawn into half without cutting all the way
through._

_Marinade:_  
1 egg  
1 tbsp soy sauce  
1 tsp sugar  
Few dashes white pepper  
¬Ω tsp chilli powder (omit if you do not want any heat)  
1 tsp Chinese cooking wine  
Serves 3 to 4

In a small pan or pot, toast the Sichuan peppercorn over low heat without any
oil to release the aroma. It should take about 2 to 3 mins. Be careful not to
burn them.

Remove and crush them into fine bits with mortar and pestle. Add salt and mix
well. Your Sichuan pepper salt is ready.

_Sichuan salt and pepper._

In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients for marinade together and add in
prawns.

Mix well and set aside for 10 mins.

In a large wok or skillet, add in 1 tbsp cooking oil and saut√© garlic, dried
chilli over medium low heat until fragrant, approx. 1 min.

Add in spring onions, fresh chilli and cook over high heat until lightly
browned.

Sprinkle some Sichuan pepper salt and sugar and give it a final mix. Turn off
heat.

Add the prawns together with some of the marinade in the corn starch.

Toss them in the corn starch and coat each of them well. Add more corn starch
if necessary.  
Lay out the prawns on a plate or tray.

Heat a pot of oil over medium heat until hot.

Carefully add in the prawns one by one. Do not overcrowd the pot. Cook them in
several batches if necessary.

Move them around occasionally to prevent them from sticking together.

Fry them for about 2 mins. Once they turn red and has a nice golden brown
color, remove and drain on some paper towel or a rack.

Add the crispy prawns into the wok and turn on heat to high.

Sprinkle with more Sichuan pepper salt and toss everything together until well
heated. Serve hot.
