Excellent!!!!! I served this with "My Thai Sesame Noodles, Recipe #413122". If
you dont have rice flour do not fret. I substituted 3/4 cup all purpose flour
and 2 tbs. corn starch and it came out perfect. I would watch how much salt
you use. I will cut back a little on this, but otherwise a very good recipe.
Wouldn't change anything, but dont be afraid if you need to do a substitution.

My favourite so far in ZWT Asia! Absolutely amazing thanks Julie, just the way
we like Asian food - simple but with flavour. I DID use ground Chinese
Szechuan peppercorns, as I love the fragrant peppery taste that they impart in
food, and they made the prawns sing in this recipe. I served these for a light
lunch with Recipe #415971, Recipe #413122 and Recipe #179839. Made as posted
and very much enjoyed. Merci FT:-) Made for the Cheese and Whine Gang.
