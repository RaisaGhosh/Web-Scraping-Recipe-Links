### Ingredients

Pork spare ribs with chilli plum sauce

  * 8 boneless pork spare ribs
  * 2 tablespoon plum sauce
  * 1/4 cup (70g) tomato sauce
  * 1/4 cup (60ml) dry sherry
  * 2 tablespoon honey
  * 2 small red chillies, chopped finely
  * 2 clove garlic, chopped finely
  * 1 tablespoon finely grated ginger
  * 1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder

### Method

Pork spare ribs with chilli plum sauce

  * 1

Preheat oven to 160°C (140°C fan-forced). Remove rind and excess fat from
spare ribs; cut into three pieces. Combine all remaining ingredients in a
large baking paper-lined ovenproof dish. Add pork and mix well to coat evenly
in the plum sauce mixture.

  * 2

Bake for about 1 1/2-2 hours, turning the pork occasionally, or until very
tender and golden brown.

### Notes

Not suitable to freeze or microwave.
