Guaranteed to be easy and tasty. These are a real winner. Great finger food
using toothpicks for parties. \- madby3

## Ingredients

  * 8 spare pork ribs

  * 1/4 cup sherry

  * 1/4 cup tomato sauce

  * 2 tbs honey

  * 2 tbs plum sauce

  * 2 chillis finely chopped

  * 2 garlic cloves

  * 1 tbs ginger

  * 1/2 tsp Chinese five-spice powder

## Method

  1. Remove rind and excess fat from spareribs, cut each rasher into 3 pieces. 

  2. Combine all ingredients into a bowl, mix well. 

  3. Place mixture into a baking pan and bake at 180C for approximately one hour, or until pork is tender and glazed. Stir occasionally. 

### Notes

I usually make a less sweet Asian dish to serve with this.

Jar chillies, garlic, and ginger work fine to keep things quicker.

I like to increase the oven temperature near the end to give them more of a
darkened colour glaze.

The ribs can be marinated prior to baking, if desired.
