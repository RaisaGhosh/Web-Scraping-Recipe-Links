Manchow soup or manchurian soup is one of the most ordered varieties of soups.
You can find a a fan-following of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian style. It
is a great appetizer full of flavor. This is Indo Chinese soup at its best.

Although it is named after Manchuria region, it has nothing to do with the
actual cuisine of that place. However, it has something for everyone. Fried
noodles, sweet, sour, spice. Very much like life. Full of flavor yet things
never remain the same in your bowl. You will always see your world change as
the time goes by. Sometimes according to your taste, otherwise you are just
watching time goes by.

## What is Vegetarian manchurian soup made of?

Finely chopped greens and veggies boiled in stock and water along with soy and
sweet chilly sauce makes it very likable. It is served with fried noodles
making it a great meal. It is perfect when you catch a cold or are depressed.

Soups are great for a light dinner with some bread. Most people get stuck at
tomato, but soups need not be boring. This Indo Chinese vegetarian soup recipe
will win your heart too. Yes, some years back I wouldn't agree too. But now I
do. You can have it daily and still not get bored. Yes, you too can find one
more reason to have it the next day. I love having them on a cold wintry night
and when it rains.

Some days eating healthy is better than having something fried. Having soups
few nights of the month makes you have your _pakodas_/fritters with lesser
guilt. If you are looking for a weight loss or just wanna have some change
from daily cooking.

Have a break and eat light!

### Which soup is best for cold?

I love having both to avoid catching a cold. The amount of spices and chilli
does help you avoid the cold when it is cold and rainy outside. They are tangy
and full of flavor changing your taste in the mouth when you have your
infection.

I love pairing it with some manchurian and Hakka noodles. Vegetable
manchurian, Gobi Manchurian or Soya chilli also works great as a vegan
starter. Paneer manchurian/Chilli paneer if you are a vegetarian. Desi Chinese
cuisine works any weekend! You can also make it with some oven roasted veggies
and veg fried rice.

## FAQs

**What is manchow soup ?**

Manchow soup is an indo-chinese recipe for soup that is made with similar
ingredients as that for any indo-chinese recipe such as Veg Hakka noodles, Veg
manchurian. In India it is served with fried noodles.

**What is the difference between Manchow soup and veg hot and sour soup?**

If you are wondering how they are different? There is a very little difference
between the two. Hot and sour soup has tomato ketchup added to it. We serve it
without the fried Hakka noodles.  
Manchow lacks the sauce but makes up with the crunch.
