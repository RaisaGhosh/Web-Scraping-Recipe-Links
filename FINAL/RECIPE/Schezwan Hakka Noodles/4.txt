####  **Ingredients:**

  * 1 packet hakka veg noodles (150 gms)
  * 1 cup cabbage
  * 1 large carrot
  * 1/2 cup capsicum
  * 2 Green part spring onions
  * 5 French beans
  * 1 tsp Ajinomoto (MSG) (Optional)
  * 1 tsp garlic paste
  * 1 tsp Soy Sauce
  * 4 tbsp oil
  * Salt to taste

 **Schezwan Sauce**

  * 10 Dried Whole Red Chillies
  * 1 tblsp Tomato Sauce
  * 1 tblsp Seasame Oil or any vegetable oil
  * 1 tsp Sugar
  * 3 tblsp Vinegar
  * 1 tblsp finely chopped Garlic
  * 1 tsp Salt

####  **How to Make Schezwan Hakka Noodles :**

  1. Lets first prepare the sauce. Soak the dry red chillies for 2 - 3 hrs in warm water to make them soft. Remove the water. In a blender make a fine paste of the soaked red chillies and garlic. You may use 1 tblsp of water to make a smooth paste. Now heat the sesame oil in a pan to the smoking point and then add the chilly garlic paste, tomato sauce, vinegar, sugar and salt. Cook for 5 mins. Keep stirring constantly. Switch off the flame and allow it to cool. Keep aside.
  2. For boiling the noodles take 8 cups of water and 1 tsp of oil in a large pan and boil it. When it starts boiling, add noodles in it and boil them for 2 minutes. Switch off the gas and strain the water through a strainer.
  3. Wash it with cold water for 3 - 4 times and immediately strain it. Washing the noodles with cold water keeps the noodles from sticking together.
  4. Now pour 1 tsp oil on the noodles and with hands mix well. Ensure all the noodles are smeared with oil. Keep it in a strainer for 10 minutes so that the water drains off from the noodles completely.
  5. Chop all the vegetables - carrot, cabbage, french beans, spring onions in thin strips or juliennes.
  6. Heat oil in a frying pan on a high flame. Add garlic paste to it. Cook it for 1 minute then add vegetables and stir fry them. Do not overcook. They should remain crunchy.
  7. Now add 2 -3 tblsp of already prepared schezwan sauce and soya sauce.
  8. Add noodles, salt and ajinomoto. Mix well.
  9. Stir for 2-3 minutes. Garnish it with chopped green spring onions.
  10. Serve hot.
