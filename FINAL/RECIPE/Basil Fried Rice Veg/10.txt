This healthy vegan basil fried rice features loads of fresh basil fried up
with brown rice, peas, corn, bell peppers and onion. Enjoy this gluten-free
and oil-free dish as a homemade alternative to takeout fried rice.

This easy fried rice dish takes just 15 minutes to make if you already have
cooked rice on hand. It's a great way to use up leftover brown rice and and is
easily customizable to whatever veggies you have available.

This recipe is vegan, gluten-free, oil-free and refined sugar-free.

## Recipe Ingredients

To make this simple, healthy fried rice, you'll need:

  1. **Brown rice.** I like brown rice best for this recipe but you can use basmati or jasmine rice if you prefer. I like how brown rice is a bit firmer than white rice. The rice will need to be cooked beforehand, so make sure you give yourself 45 minutes if you're cooking brown rice from scratch.
  2.  **Veggies.** You'll need fresh or frozen green peans and corn, bell peppers and onion for this recipe, however, you can substituted pretty much any veggie you have on hand. Broccoli, celery, green onion, zucchini and carrot also work well.
  3.  **Flavourings.** To add flavour the the fried rice, I used soy sauce, coconut sugar and garlic. You can use brown sugar or maple syrup in place of the coconut sugar if you prefer. 
  4. **Basil**. You can leave the basil out and do regular fried rice but I love the basil with the other veggies and chewy fried rice. You can use Thai basil or regular basil in this recipe.

## How to Add Protein

  * Mix in 1 cup of cooked, shelled edamame.
  * Add the scrambled tofu portion of this fried rice dish.
  * Mix in 1 package of crumbled or cubed tempeh.
  * Mix in baked tofu or serve topped with baked tofu.
  * Mix in your choice of diced vegan sausage or homemade seitan.

### Description

This fried brown rice dish makes a quick and easy, healthy plant-based dinner
the whole family will love. Serve on its own or with your choice of protein
such as tofu, tempeh or edamame.

* * *

### Ingredients

Scale 1x2x3x

  * 1 tbsp water or vegetable broth or 1 tsp sesame oil
  * 3 cloves garlic, minced
  * 1/2 medium white onion, diced (approx. 1 cup)
  * 1 red bell pepper, diced
  * 2 cups cooked brown rice
  * 1 cup green peas, fresh or frozen (190 g)
  * 1 cup corn, fresh or frozen (190 g)
  * 2 tbsp soy sauce or gluten-free tamari (30 mL)
  * 1 tbsp coconut sugar, brown sugar or maple syrup. (15 g)
  * 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, to spice preference (omit if you don't want it spicy)
  * 1 cup tightly packed, chopped fresh basil (50 g)
  * sea salt and black pepper, to taste

* * *

### Instructions

  1. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat then add the onion, garlic and bell pepper to a skillet with a splash of water or broth or 1 tsp of sesame oil. Cook for 5-8 minutes until fragrant, softened and starting to brown. 
  2. Add everything except the basil, salt and pepper and cook for a few more minutes. 
  3. Stir in the basil. Spread the mixture around the pan so it's sitting evenly then allow to sit for 1-2 minutes before scraping and stirring. Repeat 2-3 times. This allows the rice to brown and crisp on the bottom. 
  4. Season with salt and pepper if desired and serve hot or store in the fridge for up to 4 days.

This looks great! I want to try this this weekend, but should I use 2 cups of
basil or 1? You said you used 2 cups and the ingredient list calls for 1 cup.
Just want my first attempt to be perfect! Thanks ðŸ™‚

I made this last night and it is delicious! My husband and 5 year old loved it
as well! I ate it again today for lunch and I think it was even better after
the flavors soaked together overnight. Glad I made extra! Thank you!

Hi Deryn, I was wondering if you know of a 7-day vegan meal plan that I could
follow as what Iâ€™m doing at the moment isnâ€™t working for me. I've got no
energy, lethargic and a big dose of the canâ€™t be bothered. Hoping you can
point me in the right direction. Have a great day. Helen.

I have a few different things you can do. I have a 3-day plan here, a 7-day
plan here and a 3-day plan via email here. Good luck and have fun!

Fantastic! At first i thought too much pepper but its good and spicy. I love
scrambled tofu so was excited to whip it up and add it.

Awesome! So glad you tried it with the added tofu scramble. It's a bit spicy
for sure, but just enough heat for me. Thanks for the feedback!
