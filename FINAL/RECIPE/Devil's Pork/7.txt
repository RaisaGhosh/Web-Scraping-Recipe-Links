The Devil Curry as its name suggests, is a rich and fiery hot dish, prepared
with either Beef, Mutton, lamb, Chicken, Pork or Eggs and lots of chilies. In
the earlier days, Wild Boar, Venison and Rabbit were also made into the Devil
Curry. The Devil Curry is a modified version of the Jal Frazie that originated
during the Colonial Era, where the left over Turkey and Chicken Roasts were
converted into Devil Curries or Fries by giving them a makeover the next day
with the addition of a few spices.

Here is an easy recipe for **DEVIL PORK FRY**

_Serves 6       Preparation Time 45 minutes_

**Ingredients**

1 kg Pork (less fat) cut into medium size pieces

2 tablespoons vinegar

1 tablespoon Worcester sauce or Soya Sauce

2 tablespoons Tomato sauce

3 tablespoons oil

3 large onions sliced

2 tablespoons chopped garlic

2 tablespoons chopped ginger

8 to 10 Curry Leaves

1 tablespoon sugar

1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds powdered (Methi)

1 teaspoon mustard powder or paste

2 pieces cinnamon

3 cloves

3 teaspoons chillie powder

1 teaspoon turmeric powder

Salt to taste

2 tablespoons oil

Marinate the pork with the Vinegar, Worcester / Soya Sauce, Tomato Sauce,
sugar and salt for about 1 hour. Heat oil in a pressure Cooker or pan and
sauté the onions, curry leaves, chopped ginger, chopped garlic, cinnamon and
cloves till light brown. Add the marinated pork, chillie powder, turmeric
powder, fenugreek powder, mustard and mix well. Simmer for a few minutes till
the meat becomes firm. Add sufficient water and pressure cook for about 15 to
20 minutes till the pork is cooked. Open the pressure cooker and fry till all
the gravy dries up. Serve with fried potatoes, Rice, Bread or Chappatis.
