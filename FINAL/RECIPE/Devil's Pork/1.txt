Outstanding! I thought the interplay of all the ingredients was just great,
and well worth an extra trip to the store. The only complaint I had was that
there wasn't enough of it! The recipe isn't clear whether the chilies should
be fresh or dry, so I used four dried red chilies plus a few fresh green Thai
chilies. Worked out about right for me.

Superb! I had to sub 1/2 tsp thai chile paste for the chiles, and chicken
stock for the beef stock. That said, this is a great curry that is not only
pleasing to the palate but also to the eye. Very full of flavor with the first
marinated pork, then the balanced curry sauce, both spicy and mildly hot,
rounded out by the crisp lemongrass, ginger and tamarind. The curry sauce is
also excellent with chicken and for roasting tofu(fabulous with the tofu
actually!). Versatile, easy, super fragrant and family friendly (easily adjust
the spices to suit your taste -- our toddler prefered our 2nd try that was a
bit less heavy with the chilie paste.) Thanks for sharing this great curry.
