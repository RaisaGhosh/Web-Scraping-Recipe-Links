Ingredients for 1 kilogram of Pork serve 4 to 6 potions.

1\. One kilo of Pork with or without bones and less fat. Cut into 1' size
chunks. Marinate with Black Pepper, Coconut or Cider Vinegar, 1-1/2 table
spoon full of Soy Sauce, 1/2 teaspoon of sugar. Mix thoroughly and leave for
45 minutes or longer.

2\. Chop up the following into 1/2" or slightly larger size pieces.  
Two large Onions.  
Two Large Tomatoes.  
100 grams of Curry Chilies (Malumiris)  
Four to six bulbs of garlic chopped or sliced fine.  
1-1/2 Tablespoons of red dried chilly crushed to retain pieces.  
1-1/2 Tablespoons of roasted curry powder  
3 bulbs of Cloves and cardamom each and a little curry leaves.

Prepare as follows.

1\. Cook the pork on medium heat in covered pan until juices have reduced to a
thick oily gravy. Check for salt taste before adding further salt.  
2\. Place the remaining ingredients into the cooked pork and allow to fry and
cook. Stir contents for even cooking. Reduce the fire to keep food warm and
add a little shredded lemon grass a few minutes before serving. Do well with
Rice, Bread, Roti, Hoppers, String Hoppers. Complementary dish with rice would
be Lentils made Sri Lanka Style, and some fried Papadam. Enjoy, This is yours.
