# Lemon Pepper Chicken Noodle Soup

February 25, 2015

By

Mackenzie Kupfer

One of the best things to eat around this time of year is a nice steaming bowl
of chicken noodle soup. It can help warm you up and it can help with that
bothersome cold. But why settle on the plain old standby? This simple recipe
puts a great spice-twist on the classic. Mackenzie Kupfer, Avant Garden Decor

## Ingredients

  * 12 Cups  Chicken Broth
  * 4  Boneless Chicken Thighs
  * 2.5 Cups  Wide Egg Noodle
  * 1/4 Cup  Lemon Juice
  * 1/4 Cup  Olive Oil
  * 1.5 Tablespoons  Lemon Pepper
  * 1 Tablespoon  Parsley
  * Table Salt
  * Fresh-Ground Pepper

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400º F.

Lightly cover chicken thighs with half of the olive oil and all of the lemon
pepper. Place on shallow roasting pan and cook until internal temp 165º F
(approx 15-20 mins depending on size). Once the chicken thighs have cooled
enough to touch, dice into small portions and set aside.

Heat a large pot of lightly salted water until it begins to boil. Add noodles
and remaining olive oil, and boil until tender (approx 6-10 mins). Drain the
water and rinse the noodles in cold water and set aside.

In a large pot bring chicken broth and lemon juice to a boil. Add diced
chicken, noodles, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Reduce heat, cover,
and simmer for about 10 minutes. Serve or refrigerate immediately.
