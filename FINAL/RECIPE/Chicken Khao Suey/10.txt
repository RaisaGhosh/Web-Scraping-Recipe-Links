Here is a Burmese Khow Suey recipe  
to try at home.  

Khow Suey, also called Khao Soi, is a wholesome  
meal of noodles, curry and meat. It carries the  
taste of lightly spiced coconut milk and is  
garnished with a number of different condiments  
to add flavours. Khow Suey is a Burmese dish that  
was introduced to East India by those who  
migrated to the country from Myanmar during  
World War II. Today, an adaption of the recipe  
uses rice as the staple in place of noodles.

enough, add half of the thinly sliced garlic,  
fry till they turn brown and scoop them  
out on a paper towel.  

##### In the same oil, fry the thinly sliced onions.  
Once they turn brown, place them on  
the paper towel with the fried garlic.

them for 5-7 minutes

package. Once cooked, drain the water  
and wash the noodles in cold water.

and a sliced egg in a bowl with some  
finely chopped cilantro and red chillies.  
Pour the curried chicken over the dish.
