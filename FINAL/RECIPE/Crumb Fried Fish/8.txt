## ingredients

Nutrition

  * 800 -900  g fish, most firm white fish works well (when it's on sale, I use tail-end pieces of Atlantic salmon)
  * 1⁄2 cup flour (or more)
  * 2  eggs, lightly beaten 
  * 1  cup breadcrumbs (I usually make these out of some interesting leftover bread)
  * 2  tablespoons parmesan cheese
  * 1  tablespoon finely chopped herbs (such as dill or parsley)
  * salt and pepper, to taste, I use very little salt 
  * 1⁄4 \- 1⁄2 cup oil (for cooking, adjust to suit your pan)

## directions

  * Rinse fish and pat dry with paper towels.
  * Season breadcrumbs with parmesan, herbs, salt and pepper.
  * Start to heat oil in frying pan. I use a ridged pan.
  * While oil is heating, dip each piece of fish in flour, then in beaten egg, then in seasoned breadcrumbs.
  * Cook fish in hot oil until done, and nicely browned.
  * Drain on paper towels.
  * Serve with my Recipe #210251. Everyone says this sauce makes this recipe, so it is worth the effort.

Excellent recipe! I used flounder filets, and used panko bread crumbs. I
filled my skillet to about 3/4" deep and the flounder only cooked about 2
minutes per side since they are thin. Its a keeper

Delicious! We had some huge pieces of basa. I would also add a little garlic
powder and lemon rind next time. I made my own tartare, with some potato chips
and a salad it was a great meal!
