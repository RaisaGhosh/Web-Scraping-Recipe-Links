Remove fish from marinade and save marinade for later sauce.

Dip fish in beaten egg, then in floured bread crumbs.

Fry in about an inch of shortening until nicely browned.

Set aside while you make sauce.

SAUCE: To the reserved marinade add red pepper, broth and brown sugar. Bring
to a boil.

Add the cornstarch mixed with water.

Bring to a boil once more. Serve sauce hot over fish with noodles or rice.
