Among International cuisines, we hold Chinese the closest to our hearts.
Little wonder, we have had so many interpretations of popular Chinese recipes,
so much so that we donât even shy away from buying a plate of âchowmeinâ
from a stationary van or the office canteen.  
We just love Chinese food every which way they are served. But not all Chinese
preparations can be rustled up at the click of a finger, some need time,
patience, even technique.  
China Doll, a restaurant based out of South Extension, New Delhi, specialising
in delicacies from Chinaâs Hunan province shares two popular dishes from
their menu with our readers. Try making them at home on an occasion, and
youâll manage to surprise everyone.  
Steamed pork belly Hunan style  
Ingredients:  
1/2 pound pork loin roast, boneless, cut into thin slices  
1 tablespoon cornstarch, plus 4 teaspoons, divided  
3 tablespoons soy sauce, divided  
1 clove garlic, minced  
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, crushed  
1/2 teaspoon sugar  
1 pound fresh broccoli, trimmed  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided  
1 tablespoon fresh ginger root, slivered  
1 onion, chunked and separated  
10 cherry tomatoes, halved  
Hot cooked rice  
Preparation:  
Coat pork strips with mixture of 1 tablespoon each cornstarch and soy sauce,
sugar and garlic. Let it stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine remaining 4
teaspoon cornstarch and 2 tablespoon soy sauce with red pepper flakes and 1
1/4 cups water. Cut broccoli into bite-size florets and stems into thin
slices. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or large skillet. Add pork and stir-fry
for 2 minutes, then remove. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same pan.
Add ginger, and stir fry for about 30 seconds. Add onion and broccoli and then
stir fry for 4 minute. Set everything in a small bowl with sliced pork belly
cover and steam it for 25 minutes, add soya from the top, garnish and serve
hot.  
Water boiled fish Hunan style  
Ingredients:  
800-1000 g fish fillets (preferably river or lake fish, Sole)  
250-300 g cooking oil  
3 tbsp hot bean sauce  
1 chunk ginger root, sliced  
8 clove garlic, sliced  
3 stalk scallion  
2 handful Sichuan peppercorns  
1 rice bowl Sichuan dried chilli  
2/3 tbsp chilli flakes  
2 tbsp rice wine  
2/3 tbsp soya sauce  
700-800 ml stock  
1/3 tsp pepper powder  
Â½ tsp salt  
1 tsp sugar  
Chicken powder to taste  
Marinade:  
1 egg white  
2/3 tsp salt  
1 tbsp rice wine  
2 tbsp cornstarch  
Salad base:  
Â½ head iceberg  
1 rice bowl black fungus, soaked in water  
150 g cucumber, sliced  
Preparation:  
1\. Rinse the fish fillets and cut each into 3 pieces. Dry the fish well with
a clean kitchen cloth. Combine the fish with the marinade in a large bowl and
set aside for about 30 minutes. Prepare the salad base in a bowl. Heat up some
oil in a wok or heavy skillet and slowly stir in the marinated fish. Cook
until fish just starts to turn white, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper
towel-lined plate to drain.  
2\. Pour off the frying oil, leaving about 2 tablespoons in the pan. Add in
hot bean sauce and stir until fragrant. Stir in ginger, garlic, half scallion
sections, chilli flakes, half of each Sichuan peppercorns and dried chilli.
Stir over the medium heat until their fragrance is fully released. Drizzle in
rice wine and soya sauce. Continue stirring. Pour in stock, adjusting the heat
to high and bring to a boil. Season it with pepper, salt, chicken powder and
white sugar. Return fish to the skillet and cook for about 3 minutes. Turn off
the heat and pour the fish stew into the prepared bowl with salad.  
3\. Heat up 200 grams of oil in another pan. Add in another half peppercorns
and dried chilli. Stir till fragrant over the slow heat. Pour over the fish
and garnish with the curled, drained spring onions or coriander leaves.
